This week I found a very interesting chart on the “data is beautiful” reddit forum. It showed the median song duration of the billboard year-end hot 100 singles from 1960 to 2020. Data showed that in the year 1960, the median song duration is the shortest from 1960 to 2020. Then it faced a slow increase until 1992 it reached the top. After 1992 the median song duration slowly decreases until 2020.

I am not very familiar with events in the history between 1960 to 2020 that may affect the increase or decrease of the data until I saw the comment below. People under this post mentioned that around the year 1960 people can only listen to music on vinyl, and the limit of vinyl is about 22 minutes. Artists normally won't produce music just close to the limit. With the invention of tape and CD, the physical limits have been enlarged, causing artists to have more space for their creations. With stream media appearing, people tend to have shorter attention due to the large selection of music in stream media, causing the trend of shorter lengths of music.
