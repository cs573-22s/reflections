I chose a visualization this week from the reddit page r/DataIsBeautiful. It's a chart that plots the average income to the average monthly rent for approximately 20-30 cities in the US, including New York City, San Francisco, Los Angeles, and Boston. The size of each point is mapped to the population size of each city and the color of each point is mapped to the region where the city is located, e.g the Northeast, Midwest, West and South. I thought this visualization would be interesting to see because I am going to be graduating soon and will be looking for a job and place to live so information like monthly rent and income will be a huge consideration when that time comes.

I was a little surprised to see that monthly rent looked to be, for the most part, correlated to the average income for that city. I thought that there would be a few more outliers. There were only a few major outliers like San Francisco, Los Angeles, Miami, and San Jose. But the behavior of the outliers did track with my expectations because the monthly income in most of these cities was lower than the corresponding monthly rent predicted by the trendline. The only city whose monthly rent was lower was San Jose.
