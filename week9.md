What I found last week is named codex atlanticus. You can use it to explore the collection of writing and drawing by da Vinci. In the overview page, there are many graphs which look like a text book represent each page. You can choose to show pages in specific numerical order or specific chronological order. By dragging the indicator, it will show specific pages.

The subject of these pages contains have been categorized into five kinds. Each subject is allocated one color. The contend of each page is shown in section that are proportional to the subjects discussed in this page. In addition, each graph has two indicators. The indicator with solid line is positioned along the width of the graph to correspond with the page number. The indicator with dashed line is also positioned along the width of the graph to correspond with chorological year.

Compared with the visualizations I found before, this visualization contains more information. The overview give user an awareness of the entire information space. To express information, many interactions are added into its design. Thus, users can find specific information by themselves. At the same time, the view does not give people a very redundant feeling.
