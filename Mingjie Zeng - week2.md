Here's the link of this week's reflection: http://histography.io/. 
  
This web page shows the interactive timeline that spans across 14 billion years of history, from the Big Bang to 2015.
The site draws historical events from Wikipedia and self-updates daily with new recorded events.
The interface allows for users to view between decades to millions of years.
The viewer can choose to watch a variety of events which have happened in a particular period or to target a specific event in time. 
And in this page, every dot is a historic event from wikipedia.

Here's the main page of this website:

The left column lists the categories and their number of historical events happened. 
When you change from one category to another, the right area with dots with change and animate accordingly.
And when your cursor moves to a dot, the historical event and its picture corresponding to that dot will pop up, and you can click on that dot for more relevant information.

And we can change the time period of the event currently displayed on the main page by changing the selection of the timeline, and the animation effect of the dots will appear while the timeline is changed.

When you check a new time period, new dots are created and the significant events in them are marked with popping-ups and pictures.

I chose this website for reflection because it's beautiful and with quite a lot of information. The animation with the dots is delicated playful and the interaction is quite enjoyable for users.
It's actually just a simple display of events with time but the effect makes it a wonderful art thing. These dots also have the effect of a bar chart, allowing a clear comparison of the number of events occurring each year.
That's such a clever use.
