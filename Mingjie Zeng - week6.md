This week's reflection is about the world's biggest iceberg's disaster journey: https://graphics.reuters.com/CLIMATE-CHANGE/ICEBERG/yzdvxjrbzvx/index.html. 

The world's biggest iceberg named A68a has been on a slow journey toward cataclysm. The mass is now moving straight toward a remote south Atlantic island and scientists say a collision could cause a local, environmental catastrophe.

Here is the visualization about the path of the icebergs:

The blue paths are the paths of "iceberg alley", a northeast route traveled by chunks of ice that break from the peninsula.
And the gray arrow shows the current ocean travel.
And the yellow path represents the path A68a has taken and it's not common.


The scientists expect the icebergs to break apart in the ocean with all the wave action and turbulence but A68a doesn't perform this way.
It's now headed straight for South Georgia Island, making a collision almost inevitable.

And in this article, the author compares the size of A68a with the 66 concountries and territories smaller than the A68a iceberg.

Here's the straight forward visualization about the size comparision:

With the size of the seperate square, we can easily have a feeling about the size of this iceberg and the magnitude of the disaster it would cause.

And here's another visualization about the size information additional with the shape information:

With the specific shape image of the iceberg and other well-known islands, there is a clear comparision in size.
A68a is very similar in shape to Jamaica, almost as long as the U.S. territory Puerto Rico, and dwarfs China's Hong Kong Island as well as Sourtheast Asian city state of Singapore.

For the environmental catastrophe part, to analyze the influence, the authors mark where the penguins live:

Here are some points that made me feel this visualization is worthy to share.
- First, this visualization is very useful and helpful in a real and practical scenario. All these visualizations is to help to analyze the possible coming troublesome the iceberg A68a would cause. I think this is the real contribution of data visualization.
- We can see the comparision between the visualization of squre and the map in the feature of island size, seeing that every kind of visualization has its advantages and underlines.
- The use of map and path are vivid and straight forward, and they use map in different ways, one for the route that the iceberg travels and the other for the distribution of penguins, inspirating the flexibility in the way we visualize the data.
