I found this visualization interesting as it showed A LOT of information in a clear way. It lets you look at one variable if thats all you're interested in, but provides many different variables if you want to spend the time to see them all. I really like the key at the bottom that shows what production company produced the movie as well as the Oscar indicator on they y-axis. Mostly, I enjoyed the IMDB rating compared to the dollar rating - there are some movies that made a lot of money but were not rated very well and vice versa which I found very understandable.
