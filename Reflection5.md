This week I found a interesting post on dataisbeautiful Reddit forum. It's a chart that count top 20 ingredients in the bestselling cookbook "Mastering The Art Of French Cooking" by Julia Child. From this chart, we can dfound that the most frequnt used ingredient is butter, and then egg, followed by salt. This chart showed that French people love butter as the most used ingredient.

Despite that many French people love butter, studies show that eating too much butter could be bad for your heart. Morgyn Clair, RD, a registered dietitian nutritionist for Sprint Kitchen, agrees with the link between eating too much butter and heart disease. "Butter is hard on the cardiovascular system due to its high content of saturated fats," she notes. "Saturated fat leads to a buildup of plaque in the arteries, decreasing the efficiency of blood flow. Eventual effects of this plaque can be heart attack, heart disease, and stroke." If you're concerned about heart health (as we all should be), read up on these Eating Habits That Cause Lasting Damage to Your Heart, According to Experts[1].
