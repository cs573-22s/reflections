- This week I came across this visualization: https://www.pewresearch.org/next-america/#Two-Dramas-in-Slow-Motion. It is a bar graph that demonstrates age groups from newborns to elders 85 years and older. The article mentions that graph itself is called an age pyramid. Because the graph demonstrates how each group grows and and shrinks over the span of five years time periods. This particular graph shows demographic data of Americans from 1960 to the 2060. Over time we can see how the bar graph begins to transform from a pyramid shape to a more rectangular shape. The article does a great job explaining how in the Boomer era, there were more newborns than there were elderly people. Over time, cultural and societal factors shifted the norms which will ultimately lead to an equal size of newborns being born and the elderly people that continue to live which will put a strain on the younger working class to finance the retirements of the elderly.

- What I really like about this visual is that it's straightforward. I really enjoyed how the bars were animated to change with their respective time periods so the graph itself looked like it was live. Additionally, it really allowed me to visualize the historical data trend over time and seeing how the demographics for Americancs is projected for future time periods. Even more, I think it really allowed me to explore the reasoning and story behind the data. I took into account the time and culutural period Baby Boommers grew up in and how those norms have and will continue to change over time. These shifts in time will truly change how Americans will live and I think it is worth referencing this graph sometime in the future to see if accurately predicted its projections.
