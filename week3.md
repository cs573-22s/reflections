Yes I did choose another COVID visualization, but bare with me. This visualization in particular delves into the different variants of the SARS-CoV-2 virus and rather than visualizing the amount of cases or deaths caused by each variant it explores the actual mutations which make each variant unique. I chose this visualization because of its uniqueness compared to most other COVID visualizations and because it is an easy to understand biovisualization.

So in the article there are a couple unique visualizations. First we start with a map of the world that simply highlights the transmission of the omicron variant world wide– highlighting countries with local transmission vs traveler transmission. The article then delves into what mutations make omicron a unique and particularly interesting variant, focusing on the spike protein. These models of the spike protein were likely produced using UCSF Chimera, a bioinformatics tool used for visualizing and exploring 3D protein structures. Then the article quickly transitions to other variants with a quick graph of  the proportion of variants at a given time. 

Then, the visualization that I find the most interesting, is the repeated use of a visualization that displays the structure of the virus and its genome, which is then encircled by a larger version of the genome segmented by the genes present. This is used to introduce the idea of variants and then used to display the unique mutations in the explored variants later on. I found this particularly interesting because I had never seen such an accessible and easy to understand visualization of the virus or its genome let alone how to explain variants at an accessible level. This was then used in combination with the protein structures seen earlier to great effect.
