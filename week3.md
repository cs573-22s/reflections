# Icebergs
Icebergs are one of the key ways to observe the impact of climate change, especially with the recent increase of data dating back to the 1800's. The older data is typically only from warmer months and consist of photographs or ship log entries, so it can be difficult to easily understand how icebergs have changed since then compared to modern satellite technology that images the icebergs year-round. A student at Brown University named Andrew Beers focused on visualizing this data as a component of their PhD Dissertation in 2016. At that time, he collated 130+ years of iceberg data from the North Atlantic, which was the largest iceberg dataset at that time. This region of icebergs, called the Grant Banks, includes icebergs in Canada, Greenland, and Maine.

# Visualization
The visualization that Beers created ([located here](http://andrew-beers.github.io/International-Ice-Patrol-Mapper/)) has an image of the current layout of the region, a monthly timeline that is scrollable at the bottom, and a year selector to the right. The user can specify how to color code years with eight colors (multiple years can be selected as the same color). To do so, click the point color that you want, then select the year(s) that you want to appear as that color. On the map of the region, iceberg sighting data will appear as colored dots and along the bottom monthly scroll bar is a color-coded histogram equal to the number of points on the map. A feature that is useful is that when selecting a year, the year is then highlighted in the same color as it appears on the map. One can use the scroll bar to look at yearly melting and freezing patterns of icebergs and see how it changes over decades. 

# Impact
While at face value this tool does not seem to be highly complex, it did have a strong impact in environmental research. This was one of the first visualizations to demonstrate the freezing and melting patterns of icebergs since the 1800s, providing evidence of the impacts of climate change from the industrial revolution and onwards. Beers had to perform complex data manipulation in order to even visualize these trends, as he was working with multiple different sources between camera images, satellite imaging, and ship logs. He maintained features that make it easier for the user to identify what the visualization is depicting along with including an interactive element to allow this tool to be exploratory.
