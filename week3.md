While this visualization is a little old, it shows a concept of data visualization that I think is very important. 
With more traditional forms of data presentation, there's only so much of a story you can tell without
using an overwhelming amount of graphs. Well, with the ability to create and display interactive or animated graphs
and other data representations, you can show trends or variations in data in an organized fashion. 
In its standard form, the population density of Manhattan would be displayed most likely in a color-coordinated map
of the area. While this does provide the reader with a fairly accurate representation of the population, it likely
isn't very clear what is being reported on. Is the map solely based on who lives there? Is it an average
of the number of people reported in each specific neighborhood? Or just based on one random time and day? The 
ability to show the viewer an entire week of data allows them to see and come up with a conclusion about
the subject matter. While I was looking at this graph I found that just after lunch during the weekdays seemed to
be the largest number of people, far outweighing the number of people who come into the city during the weekends.
In this format, the viewer is more in control of how and what they can take away from the data. 
Another quick benefit to this type of 3D interactive vector map is how it allows for several ways to display variation
aside from just color and shade, allowing for a bar graph type comparison by changing height as well. Allowing users to
zoom in and get a much closer look at any specific area they may be interested in.
