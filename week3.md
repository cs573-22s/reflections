# Week 3 reflections

This week I was looking at a neat visualization of the stock market represented by bubbles. The visualization shows
a more dynamic graph of how a large number of companies are doing over a period of time. It works by splitting companies
into groups by industry then sizing each bubble by market cap evaluation. As time progresses a force is applied to each
bubble towards its current evaluation. Due to the physics elements, it may not be entirely accurate for a specific time,
but it allows someone without much experience to quickly evaluate the state of the market across hundreds of companies
at the same time.

I initially came across this visualization due to a link on [r/dataIsBeautiful]. So far, this appears to be the best
example of it I have seen so far, but it appears to be based on a [tutorial] using D3 made by ChartFleau. ChartFleau
also provides links to a [static version] using D3 as well as a more [dynamic version] using WebGL.
