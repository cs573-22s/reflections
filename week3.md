This visualization is a depiction of the cell tower distribution across the world. This data comes from OpenCelliD which is the world's largest database of licensed cell towers. The image display shows the cell tower locations as purple light points. A higher concentration of cell towers is indicated by increased brightness of the area. The locations of the towers on the map is determined by using the logitude and latitude coordinates of the towers. The type of tower – LTE (4G), UMTS (3G), GSM (2G), CDMA (2G) – is also used in this image. When the mouse is used to hover over an area, the total number of towers in the highlighted area is shown along with the number of each type of cell tower within that area is shown on the right of the screen. These counts are accompanied by a pie chart showing the ratio of the tpyes of towers being counted. In the pie chart, LTE is green, UMTS is blue, GSM is grey, and CDMA is orange. 

The map in the visualization can be zoomed out to see every continent, or it can be zoomed in to see specific areas. When looking at the entire world view, Europe, Japan, and the United States appear to have the brightest areas and thus mean that they have the highest number and/or concentration of cell towers when compared to other areas of the world. I also think it is impotant to mention that this is purely a display of cell tower locations and not the area that the cell towers themselves cover. Below the visualization map, there is a small breakdown description with illustrations of how the code is functioning to organize and process the data for the display.

I chose this visualization because the image caught my attetion form the neon purple. It also reminded me of the MQP project my friend did reguarding the 5G cell towers and their placement and range for various types of geographies in different areas. This could be interesting to develop and add in the 5G cell towers. The second source is the OpenCelliD website which has another similar visualization. The obvious differences between these visualizations is that the OpenCelliD display has a search capability to search specific locationd and can be zoomed in as far as specific cell towers to show the Mobile Country Code (MCC), Mobile Network Code (MNC), Location Area Code (LAC), Cell Identity (CID), Radio Type, Latitude, Longitude, and Range. While the OpenCelliD visulaixation was a better and more indepth display, I appreciated that the alpercinar website had a small desciption of their algorithm.
