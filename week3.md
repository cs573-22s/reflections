I chose this article because I found it interesting how the data used in this visualization consisted of comparing a novel's setting with the author's familiarity with it. The article looks into the concept of "Write what you know", and observes any traditions with some of English literature's most well known authors. It explores the idea of how authors are very likely to choose the setting of their writing in areas where they are familiar with or have lived in at some point of their life. I found this an interesting obeservation to make in literature, and wanted to explore the consistencies of it for some of my favorite authors. I also believe that the setting in stories is one of the most underrated elements of literature, so I thought that a study observing the reasoning behind this was unique and wanted to learn more about it. This visualization is interesting as it utilizes a variety of different charts, and even combines them at times. The kinds of visualizations utilized are frame diagrams, gant charts, and histagrams. I thought that this visualization did a great job in utilizing a variety of charts and combining them to present plenty of information in simple and effective ways. However, while I think certain aspects could have been clarified  in the illustration, that could be contributed to my lack of familiarity with certain charts. In the beginning of the article, it presents a histogram and a frame map to compare the distances between 100 author's settings in their works and where they are from. It utilizes a histogram to present the count while using a frame diagrams to illustrate the difference in distance. As the article goes on, it provides a visualization specific to each author and utilizes a gant chart and frame digram to portray information about the authors published works, the distance between the settings in their books and where they live/lived, and the age of the author at the time of publication. I also found this visualization to be incredibly informative and interactive, due to the pop-ups that are utilized when the reader hovers at a specific frame. It includes information about a specific book, the settings lived in, and the setting not lived in. After reading this article, I've grown to have a greater appreciation for how a variety of information can be presented, and the different methods to utilize it as clearly and accurately as possible, in ways that are easy to read and also effective.
