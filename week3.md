# Week 2:

My reflection for this week is from an article from the [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/interactive/2021/dejoy-usps-delays-by-zip-code-map/)

## Description:

This article explains how the new delivery regime is going to affect different locations across the USA. The new delivery regime increases the delivery time of a first class mail so much so that it was called the biggest slowdown in more than a generation. The idea was to reduce airmail so as to cut costs. But this would affect the distance a mail can travel within a day. The author has used an interactive map to explain and show the delays in the mail to different locations.


## What I found interesting?

1. The article starts with showing us an interacttive map. The UI allows us to enter a zip code or click on the map to select the location we want to check the delays for.

After selection:

The gradient in the color scale shows us how much slower the new plan will be. 

2. The next visualization shows us which parts of the country will be most affected in terms of receiving mails.

On hovering the mouse over the map, the particular area is selected and a pop up shows us the average delay in receiving mails to that location.

3. The following visualization shows us how the existing long-distance mails would be affect by the distance they are being delivered to.

4. The author also tries to highlight that the exisiting first-class mail system was late 42 percent of the times when mail was supposed to be delivered in 3+ days which brings the new system under question.
