For this weeks reflection I chose a very interesting case about the rise and fall of a company that at the time of most succes was one of the biggest in the US, and how quickly it disapeard. Blockbuster as seen on the graph, was first founded on 1986, and just after 10 years, it had 3000+ stores across the country. But that would not stop there, ten years later it had almost double the stores. And amazingly only 10 years later there would be less than 100 stores all over the us.

About the vizualisation, its a map that shows the location of the store, the current year and the total number of stores. I think the way the data is displayed allows the consumer to understend the magnitud of what happened. going from having thousends of stores to having very little in almost half the time it took to get to its peak. And this one of the many exampples of how thecnology can move so fast that it makes a relevant thing irrelevant.
