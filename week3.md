# Week 2:

My reflection for this week is from an article from the [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/interactive/2021/dejoy-usps-delays-by-zip-code-map/)

## Description:

This article explains how the new delivery regime is going to affect different locations across the USA. The new delivery regime increases the delivery time of a first class mail so much so that it was called the biggest slowdown in more than a generation. The idea was to reduce airmail so as to reduce costs. But this would affect the distance a mail can travel within a day. The author has used an interactive map to explain and show the delays in the mail to different locations.
