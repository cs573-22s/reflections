                        The Largest Vocabulary In Hip Hop

There are three visualization in this page, the first one tells us 
the number of unique words used by the hip hop stars from 1980's to 2019.
The lyrics were of the first 35,000 words of some of the top hip hop stars. 
We can notice with the visualization that ~80% artists have unique words 
between 3000 to 5000
The author designed a graph of the hip hop stars over a period of time which tells us 
that a new artist is likely to have less unique words compared to the older ones. 
The surprising part is the third graph where you notice that the country and rock 
seem to have less unique words compared to hip-hop. Based on this visualization I've
was able to make two assumptions that the over a period of time the hip hop pop stars
have become less creative in terms of writing lyrics or must be the increase in
usage of more simplistic words.
The author used d3 library to create this visualizations and a convenience wrapper 
called jetpack. I've read about it that it helps speeds up the process but didn't really
understand what that means
