My reflection this week: 
## Plastic Waste Pollution data visualisation
https://www.behance.net/gallery/106936329/Plastic-Waste-Pollution-data-visualisation


This is a visualization of distribution of plastic waste generated by continents and countries in 2010.

This is a really interesting because it integrates multiple data in a single continuous visualization. On the left we have amount of plastic waste generated by continent. This distribution is then divided into plastic waste generated per country and arranged according to the amount generated. Then the same lines continue from being curve to a straight line to display the share of plastic being inadquately managed. On the far right, this visualization also includes GDP per capita for reference.

Even though the lines from continent level to country level is overlapping, use of colors and opacity is properly done to tackle obstruction of lines.

Currently, this visualization sorts countries by amount of waste generated. I think, it would also be interesting to see how this visualzation looks like when it is sorted by amount of recycled plactics.

The second part of the visualization includes the weight of waste in each of the oceans. For scale, it cleverly quantifies the waste weight with the number of whales.
