This week’s reflection is from https://mymodernmet.com/podio-daily-routines-famous-creative-people/. It displays the daily routines of famous creative people. The categories are kept to a few simple ones, including sleep, creative work, day job/admin, food/leisure, exercise, and other. Each horizontal line represents a different person and what activity they carried out during the day. As you look across each creative person’s horizontal line, it shows how their day progresses. The left hand side begins at 12am and it continues until 11:59pm. Each segment is color-coded to allow a user to easily see how each creative person’s day is divided up. 

This visualization is really interesting to observe because a user can see how each segment relates from one person to the next. It is interesting to see how much sleep each person gets as compared to others. It is also interesting to see when and for how long each individual spends in the creative work area. This visualization is incredibly helpful with comparing individuals and noticing patterns. There are also visualizations in which sleep and work time are highlighted and the others are erased, to make the comparisons even easier.
