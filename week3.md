## Snowfall and Parcipitation Visualization

[This visualization](https://www.nohrsc.noaa.gov/interactive/html/map.html?ql=station&zoom=&loc=41.417+N%2C+73.624+W&var=snowfall_72_h&dy=2022&dm=1&dd=30&dh=12&snap=1&o9=1&o13=1&lbl=m&mode=pan&extents=us&min_x=-73.658333333336&min_y=41.099999999996&max_x=-70.000000000002&max_y=43.158333333329&coord_x=-71.82916666666901&coord_y=42.1291666666625&zbox_n=&zbox_s=&zbox_e=&zbox_w=&metric=0&bgvar=dem&shdvar=shading&width=800&height=450&nw=800&nh=450&h_o=0&font=0&js=1&uc=0) can show the estimated snowfall for and given location in the US over the past 72 hours. The visuals are a bit unclean and the UI might not be the best, but this can be a very useful tool for seeing the data, and its features are immensely complex. I feel this tool achieves exactly what its purpose is: to present to people how much snow an area recieved in the past 72 hours. Its effective, adabltable to most need, and relatively easy to use at a glance (though it is a bit complicated to figure out what metric you want to see).

This vis said we got in the 12-18 range this weekend which seems to align with what most websites are saying. It also has their data that they use posted so it might be an interesting project to remix this in a more modern fashion.

Looking a bit under the hood, this visualization was created in 2002 and most recently updated in 2011. (Interestingly, when they updated it in 2011, they didn't switch to the brand new technology d3!). The site seems to use something on the backend to create the image so I wasn't able to find exactly how it was created. It essentially just generates the image you want on each request, then just displays that image in the pane. Its impossible to find out what they use to create this, but an updated version seems to be relatively easy if one were to want to make one, especially with the newer tools avaiable.
