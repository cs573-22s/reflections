I stumbled upon a really cool visualization of the solar system, and it turns out that it was part of a much bigger project - a short movie based on the series of novels Blindsight. I decided to link to the entire project rather than just the solar system visualization, but I'm mostly gonna talk about this specific part of the project.

This is basically a simulation of what the solar system is going to look like in 60 years, based on actual orbital data. This in itself is already impressive, but the visualization is also quite aesthetically pleasing and looks like an art piece. When we look at it from afar, it looks a bit overwhelming because there is a lot of things, but upon closer inspection the details are just fantastic. We can see planets, orbits, asteroids, and the paths the spaceships in Blindsight took. It turns out this visualization is not only the solar system in 2082, but also an accurate depiction of the events that happened in the book series, on a cosmic scale. 

It got a bit more confusing when the scale changes and we can see this huge ball made up of paths, because I wasn't sure if we were still looking at the solar system or if this was some other cosmic object. From the descriptions around this simulation and seeing the spaceships leaving the ball, this seems to be the oort cloud. This cloud is a huge sphere of icy bodies that surrounds the solar system, and it seems the ships left it to go investigate something. 

Overall, I found this simulation to be visually amazing. It is a little overwhelming and hard to understand without the proper background information, but watching it a few times and reading a few sentences about it makes it much easier to appreciate it. I watched it a few times focusing on different elements and it just doesn't get old. And it's only a small part of a much larger project!
