This week I took a look at Neal Agarwal's interactive visualization of ocean depth at https://neal.fun/deep-sea/. This visualization allows the user to scroll through the ocean depths from the surface to the deepest known point. Along the way you can find which species can be found at each depth, including an image of what they look like and maybe a fun fact about them. Each ocean depth zone is labelled as well. What I like a lot about this visualization is the depth marker - it stays in a static place toward the bottom of the screen, and the depth changes as you scroll. I think most visualizations I see of this sort have discrete markers, ie 500 meters, 1000 meters, rather than a continuous one such as this. One thing I think is missing from this visualization is information about the species you come across as you scroll. I'd be interested in reading about an animal beyond simply a small image of them with their species name, especially when you come across something like the creature called a "sea pen". I think at least a link to a Wikipedia article would be great. Overall, this visualization is visually pleasing and enjoyable to interact with.
