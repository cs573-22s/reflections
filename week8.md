What I found in last week is an interesting PI chart which is about visualizing countries by share of earth’s surface. This chart shows countries by ranking the size of its area. There are several points which attracts me most in this chart.

First, the author of this PI chart put the theme in the center of the chart where it is most easily seen at first. I think this layout allows the viewer to know what this PI chart is talking about at a glance.

Second, the size of the label maps to the area of each country. I found that this sort of display by ranking its area of each country and mapping the size of label and area of country can provide views a clearer perception which country’s area is bigger and which country’s area is smaller.

Thirdly, each category is presented by a picture. In the textbook, I read about the shape and color in identity channel can allow views distinguish each category clearer. However, in this chart, each category is presented by a specific picture. So, I think that perhaps in visualization design, a picture that can represent its characteristics for each category can give the viewer a better perception.
