Cracking the mystery of egg shape

This article and visualizations talk about why different bird eggs have different shapes. 
They presented the data in a bubble chart. The first scroll represents how they analyzed the images of all the egg shapes data and sorted them into 37 different bird orders. The second scroll shows the species representation, the number of species they've analyzed 1400 species thats just 14% of all species.

The second graph is the correlation of the ellipticipty shape of the egg with assymetry. Ex: hawk owl is the most spherical egg 

The next illustration depicts the possible hypotheses by different researchers: such as clutch size, calcium conservation and roll factor but after a lot of research the scientists have found that the length of an egg correlates with bird body size and the shape of an egg relates to fyling habits. And the stronger a bird's fight, the more assymetrical or elliptical its eggs will be

The author latter explains how flying helps shape the egg. Strong fliers maken them assymmetrical so as to get the most of out of it or into the eggs. But they are always exception like ostrich and penguin where the eggs are assymetrical also. But this helps us understand a lot more of the eggs and perhaps help us understand the ultimate question which came first egg or the chicken
