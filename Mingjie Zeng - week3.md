This week I found a special but simple example of visualizing data and here is the link of example: https://www.behance.net/gallery/99114047/Population-Density?tracking_source=search_projects_recommended%7Cdata%20visualization%20dataviz. 
  
The theme of this data visualization is a very common theme, the problem of the population. 
But this visualization has a rather special entry point, not from the point of view of population size, but from the point of view of population density to represent some issues.

In order to visualize the population density of each country and to facilitate a visual perception of the comparison, 
the authors designed a uniform presentation format for the attributes necessary to be able to present population density, as shown in the following figureï¼š

In this image, which illustrates what the symbols, dots and area of the circle represent. Different symbols are for different geographical area like Africe, Americas, Asia and Europe.
Every dot represents one person and the number of dots in the dark circle represents how many people there are in one square km of land area.
And for the pink circle, it represents the total population of this country.

The following image is the main result of the data visualization.

What's interesting about this effect is that it completely eliminates the need for numerical representations in the presentation 
and uses a visual format to give the readers a very graphic representation of the results.

The advantage of this approach is that one can clearly see at a glance which country is the most densely populated, 
and which country has the largest actual population and the regional division of that country. 
This way of presenting the data is very efficient and because it has its own rules, it can be quickly applied to more country population density data or similar analysis of other data types.

For the theme itself, on the one hand it can facilitate a direct comparison of population density, as in this picture, we can clearly see that Bangladesh has the highest population density:

On the other hand, it is also possible to make a direct judgment about the total population, 
as in the following figure, we can easily determine that the country with the largest total population is India:

This kind of population density presentation is very design and artistic, 
and at the same time can fully meet people's needs for this data. 
I think it is a worthy way to learn data visualization, and can also expand people's ideas for data visualization presentation.
