This week I'm sharing a very interesting data visualization that shows the distribution of blocks along layers in the game Minecraft: https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/nir.smilga/viz/MinecraftBlocksDistperLayer_16438944312130/MinecraftBlocksDistbyLayer?publish=yes. 
  
The data comes #GamesNightViz, https://github.com/0xTiger/blockheights Extracted from 15 Regions, Minecraft Version 1.15.1.

This is main page picture of this special game data visualization:

The whole project is showing the distribution of the different kinds of blocks per layer of Minecraft. 
The total real number and type of blocks in the game are counted at the top of the page, as well as the number and type of blocks shown in this model. 
The number of blocks and the corresponding types of blocks in the area shown on the page, as well as the number of layers in which these blocks are distributed, are also counted.

On the left side of the page, the detailed type and distribution of blocks in the current area is displayed, 
each showing the proportion of currently visible blocks to all blocks in this category.

And when the user hovers over a block, it shows the proportion of the currently visible blocks in this category and the layers in which the blocks in this category are distributed in the current area.

Further, if this category of blocks is clicked, this category of blocks is highlighted in the distribution map of the main page.

When the user's mouse hovers over a block, the type of the current block and the number of layers it is on are displayed.

There is also a map window on the page that allows users to adjust the extent of the area displayed on the main page.

In addition, this model shows the types and distribution of rare blocks.

Moreover, when users click on one of these blocks, it will highlight the block on the main page of distribution.

I chose this page as this week's reflection for several reasons.

The first reason is that this page uses many different forms of data visualization, 
including bar charts, highlighting, and different display flags for different blocks.

The second reason is that the theme of this data visualization is interesting and graphic, 
using the original style of the game to make statistics about the unique block elements of this game, which is very ornamental.

The third reason is that this model is very interactive regarding the data, 
such as the ability to adjust which part of the data is displayed on the main page, the ability to highlight a specific category of data individually, etc.

Another reason is the large amount of data presented in this model, 
which is a bit long in terms of rendering time, but the final result is still worth learning.
