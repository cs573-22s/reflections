I found this visualization in Science Magazine, I found it very distracting at first and therefore a bad visualization. However, as I looked a little bit more, I realized it was a good figure for a magazine as it is eye catching. 

This figure shows how vaccines have beat infectious disease over the years. While at first it was difficult to see what the chart is actually saying, the key provides enough information that upon inspection the rest of the visualization becomes much more clear. 

Each data point provides the year, disease, and number of cases reported upon hovering. They also provide vaccine release information on the year bar on the slide which also is activated when hovered over.
