This week I found an interesting post on dataisbeautiful Reddit forum. It's a chart that Lists the top 10 oldest people in the world.

To be honest, when I saw this post, I tried to see if there are any characteristics that long-lived people have. First, nine of the ten oldest people are female from all over the world. There is nothing in common other than gender. I looked over the biographies and interviews and found an interesting but radicular fact that seems to have nothing to do with long-living, eating chocolate every week.

According to an article released by John Hopkins, having a healthy relationship with all foods is important for your mind and your body. But beginning or creating a balanced relationship with dark chocolate, in particular, may have a significantly positive impact on your overall health.

Dark chocolate contains powerful antioxidants. Among the most beneficial is a flavonol called epicatechin. Flavonols are compounds found in plants that fight inflammation and protect against cell damage caused by free radicals.
