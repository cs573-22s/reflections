This is a website of the LeetCode (a plantform which can help students to practise coding) which can display the data about the problems the user has solved yet.
There is a pie chart on the right of the page which show the data and their rate.

Introduction
---

1. The colored part in the graph indicates the problems which are finished by the user, while the grey part indicates the problems which are not finished yet. 
2. It uses the depth of the color to represent the degree of difficultly of each problem. The deeper the color is, the more difficult the problem is.
3. We can see the detail data rate by click on the corresponsing part.
4. When we move our mouse above a part of the chart, we can see the value of the data of this part.

Explanation
---

- I found this chart when I practise coding on this website. 
The reason I chose it is because its display method satisfies the user's needs for viewing the progress of solving the problems. 
- It can help users to analyze the amount of the problems a user has solved yet. 
It can also tell user the composition of these problems, the pass rate and the rate of the difficult questions among them.
- This chart is much useable and it can help the users to make the practice plan better in the future.
