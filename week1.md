For this week’s reflection I’m going to analyze a graph I found on reddit on the r/dataisbeautiful sub. The graph shown above summarizes how the creator of the graphs spends its time during a whole year, the data is taken every 30 minutes of every day. The first thing that I think is very interesting, is the way the data is displayed allows us to see patterns that otherwise we would not be able to see. For example, we can see that even though each month is different in the way the time is spent, sleeping and working are two activities that take place in roughly the same time range every month. We can also make different assumptions from the graph without knowing much about the person that created it. For example, in July we can see that he spent less time working and more time gaming, going out and some other activities. This leads us to believe that he could have taken a month off work, or maybe he lives in a city where summer is the best weather of the year, so he decided to go out. I also find it very interesting that his sleep schedule is very consistent to the hour, he goes to sleep at roughly the same time every night. The last thing I want to observe, is the choice of graph, I think in this case the user selected the best graph for the data set he had, it displays the information nicely, is easy to read and it allows us no to analyze the data. 

To conclude I’m amazed that this person was able to collect all that data and created an amazing graph. He was able to represent the data in a way that patters in his behavior could be detected and predictions made about the cause of said behavior.
