(Since I came into this course slightly late, I am going to be describing a visualization which is similar to one that I have already had experience with but is genuinely important to me.)

My reflection this week is on this [election visualization](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/upshot/2020-election-map.html)
from the New York Times. It visualizes the election results from the 2020 US presidential election, allowing the user to search by city, state or 
address to get more information about results for the specific town. Mousing over the visualization will allow the user to view the election results
for a particular county, the user can also zoom in to the map using the scroll wheel to get more detailed information. Each county and city's results are
represented by a level of blue or red depending on which candidate won by what percentage of the vote in a particular region. The user can 
also be presented an alternate view which shows the change in the results from 2016 as it relates to the 2020 election.

This visualization is important to me personally since it is reminiscient of the visualizations that the New York Times has every election. I use
their visualizations every election season and am fascinated how nice of a user experience they provide to keep up with the results
in real time. This is one of the main inspirations that I have for taking this course since it provides a lot of information in an easy-to-use and
accessible manner.
