I chose to write my reflection on "Seeing Co2", made by the Extraordinary Facility studio: https://extraordinaryfacility.com/co2/

The studio describes it as "playable Dataviz" on their website, and it is exactly that. You drive a little car around using directional arrow, and you're able to 
navigate a virtual space with a bunch of visual representations of how much CO2 is being emitted by Humans, along with 6 informational hotspots. I think it's a great idea to 
make a game out of transmitting data, especially for things that people might not want to take the time to read or look at. It's a good incentive, especially for kids. 

Overall, the game conveys data in a very visual way, comparing real size objects with different quantities of CO2, and then telling the player how much of these huge blocks
of CO2 are being emmitted each year. They have factories emitting blocks of CO2, and we can see them scatter in the air. It's felt very impactful, at least to me. The game is 
also very quick, and can be played in a browser. It also linked to other useful resources about climate.

However, there were a few drawback to this type of representation. The controls were a little finicky, and some of the hotspots were in enclosed spaces, making it hard to get
to them. Someone not familiar with games might give up because they don't understand how to get there. There was also no option to see all the unlocked information at once, 
like a summary of everything, which would have made it easier to focus on the data being presented at the end of the game. I would also have liked if they had included a 
more traditional way of seeing the data as an option, for people who might not want to play the game completely but still wanted to see all the information. 

Overall, I think this is a good way to catch people's attention, but it might need to be coupled to optional ways to see data more clearly than in the game's 3D space. As this is
a prototype, we might see further iterations of it in the future, so it could be interesting to keep an eye for this type of visualization.
