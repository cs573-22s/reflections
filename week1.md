My reflections for this week

## Population Percentage Visualization
https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/comments/s4xrca/oc_population_of_each_state_as_a_percentage_of/


This is an animated visualization of the percentage of the population of all the states in the US from 1900 to 2020. The Bubble area represents the percentage of the population. Within each bubble, there is an abbreviation of the name of the state and also the outline of the state. The bubbles have been positioned almost similar to the actual position of the state on the US map. However, it is not exact because the size of the bubble (population percentage) keeps changing over time.

This visualization does a really good job of realizing how the population percentage changed over time. It is clear from the viz that the population of California is increasing while New York is decreasing. However, I find that there are a few problems with this visualization. 

The outline of states is not effective. Since some of the states' population percentage is very low, its outline is very small and is hardly noticeable. Similarly, the name of the state is really hard to read. To make things worse, dark color scales represent a lower population percentage. So, the fact that the visualization uses dark text on top of the outline of the state makes the text even harder to read.
