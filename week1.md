# Why this?
Back in January 2020, my roommate and I were already tracking everything related to COVID-19 even though most people thought it wouldn't amount to much. One of the earlier places we had discovered reporting on COVID-19 frequently was The New York Times, and it has remained one of our resources to check first (before searching for other articles to either confirm or deny what they're reporting).

I chose their interactive world map for the first week reflections because it's one of my favorite uses of color coding. The yellow/orange/pink/purple schema holds up well to color-blindness tests (I use this website to check images https://www.color-blindness.com/coblis-color-blindness-simulator/) which was one of the crucial things discussed in my Human Computer Interaction course (ironically also in spring of 2020). In addition, not only are there separate visualizations for cases per capita, deaths per capita, total cases, and total deaths, those visualizations are distinguishable while looking at the main image. Therefore, while viewing the current hotspots, one can glance at deathers per capita without selecting it/making it the primary figure and see if there is an association with deaths and hotspots. For example, while looking at the image in this document, the reader can glance at the cases per capita and deaths per capita and see that the color for the US is approximately the same shade in each figure while the color for Brazil is slightly darker in the deaths per capita figure than in the cases per capita figure. For a full interpretation of what that means, the user would need to make each figure the primary visualization to see what each color indicates, but it is useful for high level analysis. 

Finally, the visualizations are also interactive. The user can mouse over any of the countries in each visualization to see additional data. For the hot spots visualization, this incluses the average cases per day, the average cases per day per 100,000 people, and the 14-day trend. This can help people identify emerging hot spots and compare the case numbers of each country without scrolling through lengthy lists and trying to remember numbers of countries they're interested in while scrolling.
