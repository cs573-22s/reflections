I wanted to try and find a data visualization that was far removed from traditional data representations for this first week's reflection.
The first thing that came to mind was this "temperature blanket" I had seen someone knit online a while ago. I've been unable to find where
the original idea for this type of project but I was able to find a Wikipedia article that shows several examples, some of which have even
been displayed in several museums. The basic idea is to knit a blanket or scarf over the course of a year one day at a time. The trick is to
map out either the high or low temperatures for each day in a specific location by using a different color for that day. From January
1st to December 31st you end up creating a physical chart of the annual temperature for the given year. What colors, degree range, stitch,
area, and year are chosen cause a large amount of variation. So while the practice has become very popular on the internet, most blankets
end up being a fairly unique representation of temperature data.

On the left, three Tempestries for Utqiagvik, AK representing (L-R) 1925, 2010, and 2016.
On the right, two Tempestries for Death Valley, CA representing (L-R) 1950 and 2016.
These were on display in 2018 at FutureFest in Anacortes, WA.

The Tempestry Project's display was part of the Museum of Northwest Art's Surge exhibit in the fall of 2018.
This collection contains twenty-two Tempestries for Deception Pass, WA, each one representing one year of 
high-temperature data starting with January at the bottom. This collection ranges from 1950 on the left to
2017 on the right.

These specific examples are scarfs rather than large blankets but they still show the same temperature variation throughout the year.
I like this type of data visualization because it's practical outside of its limited ability to display information. Each blanket
created this way is perfectly functional as a blanket while also being able to tell the story of yearly temperature. This being said,
while I do think that this type of data visualization is really fun it's not the greatest way to display information. To start, it 
doesn't have a key built into it. Unless you hang it on the wall next to a separate key, any blanket or scarf made in this way needs
an outside explanation to understand what the stripes symbolize. This ties into the main problem I have with many of the temperature
blankets I have seen, the colors are chosen are often imperfect. Ideally, the transition from hot to cold would be complemented by
a transition from hot to cold colors which often is with red and blue opposite each other. However the transition needs
to be able to stand out on its own, there should be no debate about which color is cooler or warmer than any other color on the blanket.
Because I am color-blind myself I often get frustrated with visualizations and representations that take for granted people's ability to
perceive subtle color variations. The best way I've seen to ensure that your visual representation uses colors that are easily
distinguished by all persons who can see is to observe the piece in black and white. The tints and shades of the colors (darker or 
lighter colors) can show the tempeature difference more clearly or in tandem with the hue (color). This problem is evident in the second photo's
Deception Pass, WA scarfs, and in the first photo's Utqiagvik, AK scarfs (left). At a glance (at least from me), the AK scarfs don't
immediately tell a story the same way that the Death Valley, CA scarfs on the right do. The right CA scarfs fairly clearly go from darker
colors to lighter colors as the temperature decreases along with the color changing. While I think the color on the scarf changes from red
to green (which is another problem) it's not impossible to read because of how drastic the dark red changes to a much lighter color. The
AK scarf however has one dark green that would seem to suggest a hotter temperature than the lighter colors yet because of where those days
lie on the scarf I have to assume that they're colder. Without the key for these scarves, it's hard to make an accurate assessment
but that's exactly the problem with some of these temperature blankets. So while I don't believe the entire concept is flawed, its execution
weighs heavily on its success.
