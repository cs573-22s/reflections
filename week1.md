The dashboard I think good is the premier league dashboad https://www.premierleague.com/ .
The most parts that impressed me is that I think the interaction is very smooth and once I move onto some signals, it will reflect quickly. Moreover, the stats dashboard is also the
point that attracts me. For example, I need to check the game history between 2 specific teams, the dashboard will list all the stats info for me. Based on these information, I could
bet a bit, which helps me win a lot! (It's just a hobby!). Moreover, it also lists some transfer information, helping me to keep in touch with the latest news. And we could compare
whatever we want, like player vs player or team vs team. It will show the stack histogram to give me a direct feeling of the result.
