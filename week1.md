This article provides information about issues in the business of prenatal screening, the inaccuracy of these test results, and the harm it can provide for future parents. Observing several large medical companies that provide prenatal tests, like LabCorp, QuestDiagnostics, and Theranos (prior to their scandal), it has been found that for every 15 times these tests correctly find a problem, they are wrong 85 times. This means that while there are 15 tests correctly find a problem, there are 85 problems that are identified, but were incorrect. This means that 85 times, pregnancies are diagnosed with an illness, when there is actually none. I found this incredibly interesting because the ability to have a business model about a subject as sensitive as prenatual health and predicted birth defeats, with the results not even being fully accurate seem to be not only unreliable, but also unethical. The reality of this situation seems to be that these companies are being supported by health care providers and insurances, by taking advantage of unknowing future parents to take these tests and find the accuracy of their future child's health with the same amount of accuracy level of throwing a dart on a board. It has been recorded in the past that these companies do not provide their patients and users with information about the accuracy levels in these tests, or how prenatal diagnoses only provide an accurate dignosis a certain percentage of the time. This practice is not only taking advantage and making a business model out of exploiting patients at extremely vulnerable times, but also heavily impacts these future parents lives as they decide how to proceed moving forward, with some measures as drastic as terminating  pregnacy.


This article does a great job at using data visualization to portray the significance of large numbers that may get lost while reading the words. The idea of 20,000 or twenty times as many, can potentially lose its meaning, and for those who are not educated in the field, people might not truly understand the significance and reality of these comparisons. This article uses illustration of simple shapes, size, and color to signify these large numbers and scales. In the beginning, article provides a relatively simple statistic of every 15 correct problems identified, there are 85 diagnoses identified as a problem when there should not have been. They do this with an illustration drawing 10 x 10 grid of circuluar objects, and utilize opposing colors to contrast the two ideas. As the article goes on, it utilizes this same grid and shape, but portrays its size differently to compare and emphasize the significance of how many times the results are right verus being incorrect, to portray how often these results are often incorrect. As the article progresses, it continues to utilize these illustrations to provide step by step comparisons about the total amount of tests are taken and the reality of the results, to then be compared against the total amount of times the test is wrong, to then be compared to how many tests were taken and the accuracy of them. The utilization of timing, scrolling, sizing, and color allow the user to easily understand the large amount of data and numbers that are being analyzed in this study. Further on in the article, it continues to utilize size to emphasize the vastness of the numbers by making the cirles incredibly small, to then zoom into a concentrated amount as the reader proceeds to then understand this small significance. By using this data visualization, it made it easier for the reader to understand the significance in the numbers, while also portraying it visually in a made that was easier to follow.
