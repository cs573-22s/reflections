This paper presents a novel big data visualization and visual analytics tool for visualizing and analyzing COVID-19 epidemiological data. The tool helps users to get a better understanding of information about the confirmed cases of COVID-19. This tool incorporates (a) data analytics (especially, frequent pattern mining), (b) data visualization, and (c) visual analytics (especially, visualization and analysis of frequent patterns). Moreover, although the tool is designed for visualization and visual analytics of the COVID- 19 epidemiological data, it is applicable to visualization and visual analytics of big data from many other real-life applications and services. 

The key contributions of this tool include the design and development of a big data visualization and visual analytics tool for COVID-19 epidemiological data. By incorporating big data mining and data analytics into the tool, one can discover frequent patterns, together with their related patterns. It provides users with flexibility to include or exclude NULL values. Evaluation results show benefits of this tool in providing a comprehensive and effective visual representation of these important patterns, which in turn helps researchers to get a better understanding of the COVID-19 disease and thus enables them to combat the disease. Moreover, this tool can be applicable to other real-life applications with NULL values.
