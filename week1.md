I'm not sure what kind of a graph this is but I've found this interesting 
becuase of the data that it represents. 
This graph gives us a good represntation of how the countries are performing in 
over a period of time for some of the most important attributes. 
In total it has six indicators and compares and helps us understand the relations 
between the different factors such as the effect of human population on co2 emissions,
education vs workplace equality amongst men and women, and living standards vs health.
In addition it also helps us compare these attributes aross different countries and 
the overall world human development index. 
I've played with the graph and made comparisions between the developed countries and
the third world countries and we can clearly notice a difference in living standards and
health and workplace equality but the co2 emission seem to be higher in the developed 
countries. 
The tool also gives the basic statistics of the data below and the ranking of the country
in the according to the human development index.
