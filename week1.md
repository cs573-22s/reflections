My reflection for this week is this data visualization tool that I came across online. (https://pudding.cool/2017/04/beer/)

This tool has been created to explore the different cities in United States in order to find out the city which has the best breweries in the country. 
The website starts with the page picking up your location and posing a question asking you if you think your city could be the microbrew capital of the US (Screenshot1.png).
The background in of the page shows the map of the US.
As we scroll down, a text appears explaining the rank of your city in the country while the background zooms into your location (Screenshot2.png). 
As we scroll further down, we are told that the microbrew capital of the US is the city of Santa Rosa, California as the background zooms into the city of Santa Rosa (Screenshot3.png).
The author then explains his methodology of evaluation of cities which is based on both the quality and the quantity of beers.
In the next section the author has marked the top 50 cities on the map with the top 10 being labelled. The sizes and the darker shades of the markers show that those cities are ranked higher (Screenshot4.png).

The author then gives us the opportunity to explore the rankings by ourselves. We get the option of selecting the criterias such as minimum number of breweries, distance and strength of the beer.
We are also provided with a slider which allows us to select the importance we want to give to the rating of beer and the number of breweries nearby. When we slide the slider, we notice that the graph also rotates as per it and the list of best cities updates according to the parameters selected by us.

The next screen then plots the number of breweries that have opened up each year following by the screen which has then plotted the number of breweries opened per 1M people for all the states from 1997 to 2016.
