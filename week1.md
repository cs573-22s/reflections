The visualization I focused on this week is one I found in the Nature article "The visualizations transforming biology" (https://www.nature.com/articles/535187a). The visualization represents how fat cells respond to insulin in the insulin/IGF1 signaling pathway (ISP). This pathway regulates important biological processes such as apoptosis, energy storage, and transcription, requiring a precise ordering of events in protein phosphorylation networks.

To represent such complex data, Ma et al. (2013) developed a strategy inspired by 19th century civil engineer Charles Joseph Minard's chart of Napoleon's invasion of Russia. The chart represented six kinds of data, such as troop numbers, temperature, and geography. Ma et al. developed the method, which they call Minardo, to represent time-course events in cellular systems, including the ISP. Their chart is a clock-like depiction of a cell treated with insulin, with each consecutive phosphorylation event moving clockwise around it. Other information included in the chart is the location of proteins in the cell and how they are related to other molecules. An animated version of the chart can be found here: https://www.cell.com/cell/enhanced/odonoghue, and a description along with the static version can be found here: https://www.cell.com/cell/pdf/S0092-8674(15)00497-3.pdf. 

Finally, Minard's chart which inspired the ISP visualization can be found here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Minard.png.
