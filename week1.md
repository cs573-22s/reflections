Reflection 1

This week I looked at a visualization of rising temperatures across Europe which was recently published by the European Data Journalism Network (EDJNet). The interactive map allows users to explore europe and view projected rises in temperature across all of the continent, allowing us to view not only large scale trends, but also what will likely happen on a more microscopic and potentially personal level by viewing the data at the level of individual towns and cities.

I connected with this visualization for a few reasons. Firstly, I find data journalism fascinating and incredibly important for exposing alarming data to the public in easily digestible and attention grabbing ways. To that point, I think this type of journalism focusing on the climate crisis is even more important given the sheer gravity of that issue and damage it will inevitably cause if it is not gotten under control. I even recently was part of a project to create a ML model which could estimate a corporations environmental impact from their twitter feed– a first in the field to try to expose corporations using NLP techniques along with some simple ML models. Essentially, the root behind the idea being it would give scientists and journalists a method to hold corporations accountable for the damage they are causing to our environment. So, seeing this visualization coming from many of the same sentiments as the model I created allowed me to connect with it pretty easily.

From a more technical angle of data visualization rather than the motivations behind them I found this was a fairly accessible visualization. In that it is merely an interactive map colored on a scale from white to red, which may be reductive, but also feels like something that I could potentially create instead of an overly complicated visualization with animation and menus and all these other bells and whistles. While I’m sure the code is still beyond my grasp right now, it feels like something I would be able to achieve with some relative effort compared to others which as of yet feel far beyond my ability. Additionally, the color scale reminded me of the conversation in class we had about rainbow scales being generally bad and misleading when it comes to interpretation. Whereas a binary color scale, such as the one used in this map, is much more user friendly when it comes to interpretation of the data.
