This week I examined a combined data visualization and article called "Lord of the Roths: How Tech Mogul Peter Thiel Turned a Retirement Account for the Middle Class Into a $5 Billion Tax-Free Piggy Bank". This is a piece of investigative journalism that uses a visualizations to aid in telling the story as you scroll. Through the article, we learn of how Peter Thiel, a billionaire founder of Paypal, used a Roth IRA worth under $2000 in 1999 and turned it into an account worth $5 billion. One of the major visualizations features how Thiel accrued this wealth by using the original money in the Roth IRA to buy many shares in a startup for fractions of a penny before the company goes public, then using the wealth gained to buy more shares in other companies. Another visualization shows the value of Thiel's Roth IRA over time as you scroll through the article. The graph grows across the page as you read about how he invested in promising startups using the money within the Roth, including what would become Facebook. Around 2016, you can see the value shoot across the page, growing by $3 billion in 3 years. 

I thought this piece was a very unique use of data visualizations. The visualizations were impactful, emphasizing the sheer amount of wealth accrued over 20 years through loopholes and investments uniquely available to people like Thiel, all the while learning about how he managed this. It was striking to see the value of the Roth IRA grow as we read about how he believes that "fortunes are built not by luck or unfair advantage, but by discerning investors and founders who are more courageous than their peers". It made me consider how visualizations can be used to help tell a story and emphasize major points rather than to simply be used as the story itself.
