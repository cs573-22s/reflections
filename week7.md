This week, I found a visualization of a COVID dashboard by InformationIsBeautiful ([link](https://informationisbeautiful.net/visualizations/covid-19-coronavirus-infographic-datapack/)).
It visualizes various statistics related to the COVID-19 pandemic and gives the user a somewhat interactive way of exploring them. While there are a lot of visualizations on this page,
I mainly want to focus on a few aspects. The first is a chart showing countries' infeection, death, and vaccination rates. What caught my attention about these graphs is how much infomration can
be packed into one chart: they detail both the measurements in terms of both absolute numbers and as a ratio per 1000 people represented by a small unit chart. I also appreciated their 
use of complementary colors to help contrast the different fields. Another interesting aspect of the dashboard is the "Country Comparer" which gives a way for users to compare the 
same data but in context to these values over time. I thought it was interesting from an HCI perspective to put the country fields on the top since the user sees the fields immediately after
scanning. I also found exploring the bubble chart visualization describing the different treatments for COVID very interesting and informative.
