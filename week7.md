Many of the guidelines that inform how designers create data visualizations originate in studies that unintentionally exclude populations that are most likely to be among the “data poor”. This paper explores which factors may drive attention and trust in rural populations with diverse economic and educational backgrounds - a segment that is largely underrepresented in the data visualization literature. In 42 semi-structured interviews in rural Pennsylvania (USA), the author finds that a complex set of factors intermix to inform attitudes and perceptions about data visualization - including educational background, political affiliation, and personal experience. 

The 42 interviews revealed a complex tapestry of motivations, preferences, and beliefs that impacted the way that participants prioritized data visualizations. Participants valued clarity and simplicity, at times gravitating towards simple bar graphs and line charts. Other participants assigned high value to color and visual appeal. In addition, highly educated people were more likely to value the source of a data visualization, and that trust can align with political identity.
