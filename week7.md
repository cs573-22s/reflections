I chose a network graph of all the connections between the characters in the star wars universe. I think this piece is very interesting because it's more art than it is a usable/informative visualization. The author color coded the type of relationships the characters have, and it resulted in a very colorful and visually pleasing piece. It is not very informative however because with 20 000 characters, it would be very difficult to have their names show up anywhere, or have a way to identify which nodes belong to which characters. There is also no legend, beyond the explanation given by the text.

I found that over the course of looking for visualizations, I've mostly been drawn to pieces that have an artistic side to them. I think maybe it's because I'm used to looking at actual visualizations for class, but I think that they bring novelty to the topic, and sometimes they might even contribute to the field.
