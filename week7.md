# Week 7:

My reflection for this week is [this article](https://www.vox.com/science-and-health/2018/5/29/17386112/all-life-on-earth-chart-weight-plants-animals-pnas) from Vox.

## Description:

The article shows all life on earth using 1 single chart. This helps create a scale in our minds. 

## What I found interesting?

1. The article uses gigatons instead of population to represent all the different life forms.

2. As we scroll down, we are able to find humans as a comparision to plants. Further down we are shown that each small cube equals 1000 tons which roughly the weight of 2000 cows.
