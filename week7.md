Being from New York and having to suffer through commute times ranging from 15 minutes to an hour, and sometimes even more depending on the day, it was interesting to find a visualization that portrayed how commute times compared across the country. The visualization utilizes a heat map, with the colors representing the average time that it normally takes for commuters from that area. The visualization utilizes popups when hovered over a neighborhood on the map, to inform users of their average commute time. They also provided the option to input your zipcode and average commute time to compare your commute to those in the zipcode, the neighborhood, and the state the zip code is in. Utilizing a heat map and a bar graph, it provides the user context for their specific region and also how differing areas might be. This visualization was interesting to learn from because of the interactive map that was provided, and the hovering popups, to have users interact with the map to learn about each specific region. Additionally, the website provided tables to see how cities across the country varied by their commute time. I found that the heat map was easy to interact with and that the popups made it much more engaging. Then, by having the user able to put in their own data, they can make a personal connection with the visual.
