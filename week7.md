For this week’s visualization I opted for something less technically impressive and more visually artistic. While a more traditional infographic I feel like this visualization neatly and captivatingly shares its information through the use of well planned colors and design. But what are we looking at actually? This week’s visualization is an infographic on wine pairings. I chose this topic because I do find myself drinking and cooking with wine semi frequently, but knowing what to choose or what people or recipes mean when they say a dry red wine would work well in this sauce isn’t intuitive. So I’ve found myself using this visualization and others similar to it so that I can choose an appropriate wine in regards to what myself and my friends will be using it for.

On a more critical level, not having interactivity means that users have to parse through a lot of information at once to get what they need out of this graphic. It also prevents the user from really exploring the relationships between types of wine or types of accompanying food. However, I’d wager a guess to say that the users of this infographic wouldn’t generally have a need for that level of interaction since this is likely just being used a reference in the store or when planning out a grocery list.
