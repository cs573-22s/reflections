## Reflection
This week I wanted to focus less on the visualizations themselves, but find a good example of exploratory-data-analysis to better understand how to perform one and what types of question/graphs work well with the reader. While I looked at a few different examples including the notorius iris dataset and car datasets I settled on this one about video game sales. The first thing many of these datasets start off with is a Problem statement or Goal/Reason for choosing the dataset and what they may hope to find. Next many of these exploratory papers include a detailed description of the data and fields that it contains. The rest of the research is typically broken into sections detailing each question the researcher might have, some visualization of that data, then an analysis of that visualization/data to see what trends were exibited. Sometimes the individuals may include a hypothesis of what they expect to see and explain why it was right or wrong. Other good ideas include talking out potential outliers, giving more history about the category in relation to the data and including interactivity in graphs to keep reader entertained. This formula that we see addapted in popular news outlets like the pudding, nyt, and more. Finally most exploratory data analysis pages end in some sort of conclusion that sums up the research and potentially a future research for ideas they may not have had time to look into. This layout looks pretty soundproof and useful for most exploratory data analysis. One of the hardest parts of the process is finding interesting/unique questions to ask about your set of data (or finding an interesting set of data). Of course more interactive data visualizations can provide more insight and readability for the user but are not always necessary.
