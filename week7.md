Week 7 Reflection - iStoryline: Effective Convergence to Hand-drawn Storylines
--
Storyline visualization is another interesting perspective in data visualization. It looks at converting a entire film or novel to a visualized storyline. However, there are many perspectives to take a look at: empty spaces, minimizing line crossings and wiggles. There are already techniques working on that. In the paper written by Tan Tang, Sadia Rubab, Jiewen Lai, Weiwei Cui, Lingyun Yu, and Yingcai Wu, they look at producing optimal results comparing to hand-drawn storyline. They used the results from their survey to design a tool iStoryline to help summarize how artists utilize narrative elemtns and the sequence of actions artists follow to portray expressive and attractive storylines.

Their tool is capable of doing the following:

They used a workflow from letting users to optimize and interact with the application in arranging and placing the visualization elements as well as use shifting and bending to help create and establish the graph. Thus, they enable the users to create storyline first by hand and automatically beautify it with algorithms.
