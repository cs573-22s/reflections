The vizualization for this week is a large analysis of various screenplay dialogues broken down my gender and age. The images on the website transition between different visualizations. The blue represents lines of male characters and red represents lines of female characters. The first image considers disney movies and separates them based on the distribution ratio of male to female lines. As the user scrolls down the page the bars collapse to the left into small circles before transitioning to the top in a line. Those cicles are then multiplied to include 2000 screenplays instead of a few disney movies. Hovering over each dot can reveal the related screenplay along with the line distribution ratios. There is also a percentage marking to indicate the percentage majoirity for the movies. Again the transitioning between rede and blue becomes a white/grey which indicates being closer to a 50/50 split between male and female lines. Scrolling again, the thrid visualization is revealed throught the transition of the columns of circles ito lines which swing to the top to combine into one bar which can still be hovered over. These first three are all different representions of the gender ratios. Further down, there are bar graphs to show the percentages of total words by age for both genders. Even further down, there is another interactiive visualization which allows for the user to choose the percentage of lines by gender and also specifies how many ilms are included in each category. Each category can be selected individually and then a specific movies can be hovered over to see the number of words per character. All of the interactive images can be choosen by genre as well as just looking at all of them. Also the final image can be broken up by genre as well as decade. 

Having the website function in this way keeps it interesting and engaging for the user. There are various methods and representations used and the transitions between them are smooth.
