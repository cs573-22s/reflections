This weekâ€™s visualization comes from https://informationisbeautiful.net/visualizations/a-taxonomy-of-hipster-coffee-shop-names/. This uses several large network diagrams to break up different coffee shops in London. The first graph breaks them up by taxonomy and the second breaks them up by locations. The graph provides a legend which indicates what the different sizes of circles mean. In this visualization, the bigger the circle, the more popular that cafe or coffee shop is. The color scheme of this visualization is very eye pleasing and uses colors in the same family group, and just makes them darker or lighter for comparison. In the darker colors, the text is lighter and in the lighter colors, the text is darker to allow for better readability. 

The design elements of this visualization are also interesting because they use each coffee shop's logo to write out its name. This makes the name more recognizable to people and much more interesting to look at. The way the data was divided up is also interesting. There is no clear explanation of how these coffee shops were broken up by taxonomy or who created the categories, but it is still interesting to look at. Some of the coffee shop names can be difficult to read because they are so small. Technically, this visualization is very simple and basic, but there was a lot of thought put into the design component, which is why I selected it.
