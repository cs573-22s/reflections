For this week's reflection, I chose a picture from an article titled as Industries and Economies Leading the Robotics Revolution. 
  
The data visualization picture is shown as below.  
The original article link is: <https://www.bcg.com/publications/2015/lean-manufacturing-innovation-industries-economies-leading-robotics-revolution>

This graph shows the percentage of robotic shipments in each country at different years.  
  
I chose this graph to share as this week's reflection for the following reasons.
  
First, this graph shows data on robot shipments in many dimensions, including years, countries, and specific percentages. Even in terms of time dimension, it contains both actual data and predicted data at the same time.
  
Second, this chart looks like a simple bar chart, but each bar is actually a pie chart, so this chart is actually a combination of multiple pie charts. This approach is innovative and informative for me. 
  
Third and the most important one, this graph makes the pie chart more comparable. 
As the example given in the first lecture, one of the characteristics of a pie chart is that it is not intuitive to compare the components, and it is not intuitive enough to compare two or more pie charts of similar composition with each other.
However, this chart converts each pie chart into a bar format, allowing for visual comparisons between the individual pie charts, and we can clearly see the trend of each part of the pie chart. The most interesting point is that this representation clearly shows the total share of certain components. For example, if we want to know the proportions of China, the US and Japan in the robot shipments industry, we can just focus on the three different green sections, which clearly shows this data.
