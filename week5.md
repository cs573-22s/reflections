The visulaization itself uses open source code from various projects. This visualization is a depiction of the wind forcasting for the globe. There is a key in the bottom left of the screen that shows the wind speeds by color and under the key a a record of the last update done and when the next update will occur to keep the visuaization accurate with the current and feauture predictions of the weather. The image itself shows the the wind forcast, speeds, and map along with the temperature, and precipitation predictions. The middle bottom of the screen has a option of choosing the day and time that the user wants to see the forcast for. The time is in the interval of three hours (i.e 7Am. 10Am...) The bottom right corner has two boxes. One box is used to help select locations of interest. The other box has interactive options of showing the particles or arrows to indicate the direction for wind speed, changing to show the air temperature, and the precipitation predictions. When one of these options is selected the bottom left bar changes to the necessary measurement. The map style can also be changed from this box between either gradient which shows the transition between measurements and edges which shows the more solid boundary lines. Under the option for map style is the forcast model which can be changed between superforcast and superforcast. However, the super forcast can only be shown over the united states and a potrion of Europe and a very small bit of Africa. It can also be choosen by hour instead of the three hour intervals. There is also a settings button in which the user can change the units and meaurments as well as the general settings for language and time format. 

The map in the visualization can be zoomed in more to see the mapping of streets. When looking at the entire view, this visualization could be used to analyze or understand the weather patterns. This type of visualization was intended for water events (kitesurfers, windsurfers, sailors, paragliders, etc.)  The information presented in this could be used to make plans for what times and day would be best to go out on the water. Aside from water events, this information can be used for various different businesses to minimize risks in things like construction when considering hieght, placement, positioning, and materials used in the development of a structure. Another option is using it for insite in the placement of wind power sources like wind turbines and the like to generate the highest yeild. Also keeping an eye on the wind movement/direction can help when monitoring storms or other weather concerns in order to better prepare for any possible intense or dangerous conditions.
