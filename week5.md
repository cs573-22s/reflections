For this week I chose to look at a visualization about volcanoes. It tracks all volcano eruptions since the 1980’s. This visualization was created using tableau and as such allows for an easy exploration of the data. I chose this article for a couple reasons. First, it shows how visualizations are made iteratively and what you make at first likely won’t be the best version of the visualization possible and second it could be a nice case study in the use of color and symbols in a visualization.

When looking at the use of colors and symbols in the tableau dashboard you can tell a lot of thought was put into the choices made because you don’t need to put in much thought yourself to take in this visualization. The scale of red to grey denotes newer to older eruptions, which makes sense because as magma cools and becomes older it goes from a bright hot red to a cold and hardened black rock. The symbols on the map are also intuitively lets the user know they are volcanoes without having to reference a legend because they are triangles and the shape of a stereotypical volcano is a triangle. Combine this with the ease of use and interactivity of a tableau dashboard and you’ve got yourself a very informative yet accessible data visualization.
