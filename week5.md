This is quite a dive by Moises Velasquez-Manoff and Jeremy White for The New York Times. They look at the potential danger of melting ice from Greenland flowing into the Gulf Stream.

An animated map of currents and temperature, reminiscent of NASA’s Perpetual Ocean from 2011, shows what’s going on underwater. The piece flies you through as you scroll with a familiar view as if you’re in space looking down.

Keep reading though, and you’re taken underwater 800 feet below the surface. It’s like seeing the currents from a fish’s point of view.

The transition of this 3D visualization is very cool to me. I wonder how did Moises Velasquez-Manoff and Jeremy White do it and how long did they take. BTW, the birdview visualization kind of looks like the Starry Night painted by Vincent Van Gogh. In addition, the idea of diving into the ocean is also very creative and impressive. One thing I've learned from this visualization is that design is very important. The first step of a good visualizatoin is to have a good design and catch others' eyes.
