# Week 5:

My reflection for this week is [this article](http://selfiecity.net/) from the Washington Post.

## Description:

The article investigates the growth and decline of population in the various states of America.

## What I found interesting?

1. The article starts with the title displayed and a visualization in the back.

2. Then the article explores a few states:

And then shows us a few together in this next visualization:

3. The next few visualizations focus on the different regions in America and try to make cases to explain the rise/decline in that region over time.

4. The last visualization is an interactive one where the article asks us to select a state or we can even hover over the visualization and the state is highlighted on the visualization as shown:
