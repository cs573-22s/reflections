## Reflection

The Stories Behind a Line is a visual narrative of six asylum seekers' routes to freedom in Italy. The visual representations of the path these individuals needed to take is both a powerful storytelling tool as well as an appealing minimalist graphic. The graph's interactivity and supplementation of stories at each of the major points is what gives the paths character and make you care more about their journys. Interestinly the author provides options of how to display the data which help the user get a better picture of the journey. While the minamalist lines are appealing the addition of a map can help the user interpret the data easier. There is also an accompanying barchart like format of the graph that depicts the time spent traveling and staying in each loaction before their libiration. Overall this does a great job of storytelling with data visualization and walking the line of visually apealing and functional.
