I chose a visualization of the different categories that make up the earth's biomass. This graphic starts by focusing on animals, and breaks down different categories while showing how much biomass they contribute. I like that cubes are used to represent biomass units, because it adds a scale to the visualization and it helps see how different categories contribute different amounts.

The graph is visually pleasing, and is kept simple and uncluttered despite having a lot of information. Most of the text is in grey, which allows the focus to stay on the colorful parts, but we still know we have access to more information if we want to read it. Some nice details are also added on the cubes, we can see examples of which animals belong to each group. It really helps make the graph even more visual and easy to grasp, because people might not know what Annelids are but they will know what a worm looks like. 

Towards the end, the scale of the graph shifts to show how different groups (animal, plants, fungi, etc) contribute to the biomass. The transition feels seemless and natural, and we get a really good sense of the scale of things. 

Overall, I think this visualization is very aesthetic and informative, and it helps put our place in the biomass in perspective.
