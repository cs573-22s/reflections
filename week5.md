This paper demonstrates visualization rhetoric as an analytical framework for understanding how design techniques that prioritize particular interpretations in visualizations that “tell a story” can significantly affect end-user interpretation. It draws a parallel between narrative visualization interpretation and evidence from framing studies in political messaging, decision-making, and literary studies. It also presented devices for understanding the rhetorical nature of narrative information visualizations, informed by the rigorous application of concepts from critical theory, semiotics, journalism, and political theory. 

The paper draws attention to how design tactics represent additions or omissions of information at various levels—the data, visual representation, textual annotations, and interactivity—and how visualizations denote and connote phenomena with reference to unstated viewing conventions and codes. Classes of rhetorical techniques identified via a systematic analysis of recent narrative visualizations are presented, and characterized according to their rhetorical contribution to the visualization. It describes how designers and researchers can benefit from the potentially positive aspects of visualization rhetoric in designing engaging, layered narrative visualizations and how the proposed framework can shed light on how a visualization design prioritizes specific interpretations. In the end, the paper identifies areas where future inquiry into visualization rhetoric can improve understanding of visualization interpretation.
