Introduction
---
This website lets you see and understand the relative size of the full range of known objects in our universe,
From the tiniest microcosm to the vast reaches of outer space
including the galaxies and the planets in the universe, as well as the human and the other animals and plants on the earth and
the microbes like bacteria and virus, and even smaller objects like molecule and atom.

You can see the relative sizes of objects arranged on a single scale, 
and grasp the sizes of things that you cannot compare side by side in the real world.


Explanation
---
- The main background is a grid map, which shows the different objects' figure and are moving from the big objects to the small ones.
  You can also change the range of size of the objects by scrolling the mouse.
- From the left to the right shows the objects from small to big.
  And there is a scaleplate under these objects which shows the range of the size of the objects.
- You can jump to the page you want by clicking/tapping on the bar that indicates a scale position. 
- You can scroll by mouse wheel or swipe the screen left and right with a touch device.
- Clicking/tapping the object of your interest will take you to an explanation of the object and its size.
- You can see the explanation by clicking/tapping the object or white bar on the bottom of the object.
- The object you selected will be displayed together with other objects for size comparison. 
  By clicking/tapping the “Bigger” or “Smaller” Button, you will learn more about the object you selected.
- Clicking or tapping the back button will return you to the original page.
- Clicking or tapping a unit or title will bring up related explanations about the unit.

Analysis
---
- This chart shows the size difference among differnet objects in a fantastic way.
  For the objects which are common in ourlife, like rabbits, dogs, and trees, it's easy for us to tell the difference about their size.
  However, for the huge objects, like the planets, or the tiny objects, like bacteria, it's different to perceive their specific size.
  Although we can learn about data such as Saturn's diameter, 
  the numbers can't give us an intuitive sense of how big it is or how much it is bigger than the earth.
  This chart uses the method of contrast to intuitively show us the size relationship of objects that we can't observe by our naked eyes.
