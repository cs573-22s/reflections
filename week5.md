This week I came across this visualization: https://www.visualcapitalist.com/history-of-pandemics-deadliest. I really like this visual because it serves as an infographic the demonstrates the magnitude of various pandemics over time. The magnitude in this case is the death toll each pandemic presented during its time. I think this infographic serves well in helping people visualize how pandemic outbreak compare respectively especially during these times where there is a lot of false information and negative attitudes towards vaccinations being spread. I think that by demonstrating how past pandemics presented themselves opens up the discussion of how people during those times made efforts to mitigate the effects of those pandemics. Of course, over time, medicine and science has modernized and continues to develop even now with COVID, but like most infographics, I think this one does a great job of encapsulating the big picture and lets the audience ponder and ask the necessary questions.

In terms of design, I like how the creators made each pandemic picture vary in size based on the death toll each of those claimed. This really helps making easy comparisons across the timeline. Additionally, I like how the time series is presented in 3D as well, with the earliest pandemics to moost recent pandemics scaling from the depths of the time scale to the front of the scale. It gives this effect of almost looking back in time which is what the infographic aims to convey.
