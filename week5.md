Can we talk about the gender pay gap?

Eventhough some people think gender pay is a myth.
The truth is that gender pay exists. The blog/researchers beyond this post indictaes that full time working women in general earn 20% less than men. The highest paid jobs are mostly held by men.
Interesting view, that some jobs where the perecentage of women increases the jobs become less interesting 
the overall pay of the jobs tends to decrease.
I would like to quote "It says that the perceived worth of a job depends on which of the two sexes holds it."
Also the first dot graph indicates that difference in pay increases with more working hours
There is an interesting live infographic that shows the amount paid for women and men the time I spent on the webpage and it shows a significant differenct in pay
