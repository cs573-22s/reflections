This week's vizualisation I explored a radial viz that shows Kobe Bryant's scoring during his time in the NBA. I think the radial format help the viewr understand the impact he had each season by adding colors to the dots in four differnt categories, this way we can see how consistent he was durinf his career. 
It also shows how the way he played affected the outcome of the season for the team. When had multiple games with a lot of points they had a good season. I think it also highlitghts how good he was from early in his career.
