This week, I focused on the cause of death (COD) visualization from the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation found here: https://vizhub.healthdata.org/cod/. I found this visualization to be very impressive due to the amount of data available, especially for the cause of death and location parameters. The causes of death can be divided into many different subsets; for instance, I can view the data for:

A "Communicable, maternal, neonatal, and nutrional diseases"
A.2 "Respiratory infections and tuberculosis"
A.2.1 "Tuberculosis" 
A.2.1.2 "Drug susceptible tuberculosis" 

Each COD subset is similarly detailed. The location parameter is also quite detailed. One example of a set and its subsets is:

"Global" -> "Western Europe" -> "United Kingdom" -> "England" -> "South East England" -> "Kent"

Given a COD and location, we can then view the data in 24 different age groups, such as 28-364 days old, 40-44 years old, and all ages. The visualization itself is easy to read and use. Some CODs also have markers indicating important registrations to the database with the corresponding source and more detail about it.

My only dislike about this visualization is that the site forces you to select "male" or "female" when viewing the data, such that I cannot view the data for a full population disregarding gender, which seems like a major oversight. I think this highlights the importance of considering your design from the perspective of a user and thinking about what a user might expect from a visualization.
