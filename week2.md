This is a great example of scrollytelling that I was sent. One of the best things about this is that it presents a very hard concept in a simple and intelligent way. The "stop the difference" is clearly shown by transitioning between the images as the user scrolls. The relevant context for each of the images was shown, as well as professional analysis for each of them. This achieves the goal of simplifying complex satellite imagery and the especially complex differences between them. 

This article makes a very complex topic accessible and does it in a simple, clear, and user friendly way. The user, at the end, has a clear understanding of what these pictures mean, and why they are important. This is much more than could be done than with a side-by-side or slideshow.
