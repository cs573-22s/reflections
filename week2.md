Introduction
---
This is a chart which shows the emotional experience and the relationship between the main characters during the ten seasons in the sitcom *FRIENDS*.

Although I haven't watch this sitcom before, I have heard about some plots in it. The two main characters Rachel and Ross fell in love and broke up for several times.

And this chart gives the fans a intuitive and lively show about the changes of their relationship.


Explanation
---

- The chart is organised by the timeline.
- On the left of the chart, there are ten numbers in grey which indicates the ten seasons of this sitcom.
- On the right of the chart, there are some classic and core plot in of *Friends* by the chronological order.
- On the op of the chart shows the indivldual avatars of the six main characters. 
  While on the bottom of the chart, the author put the avatars of the couple together.
- The core part of the chart is the colored lined in the middle. 
  When two lines are crossed together, it means that someones fall in love and the name of the plot is bold on the right. 
  Also, there will be a heart figure on the intersection of the lines.
- Although this chart doesn't have as much meaning as the chart about the epidemic and the COVID, it's quite interesting, especially for those fans of *Friends*.
