My reflection this week: 
## Mountains out of Molehills

https://informationisbeautiful.net/visualizations/mountains-out-of-molehills/

This visualization is a timeline of media inflamed fears. It show world's major fears and its frequency as mentioned in the media at any given time.
When you click on an area, it shows the description of the fear in a box. The visualization also gives us the ability to switch from intensity scale (no. of news media mentions) to death scale.

It is interesting to see how some frequencies of fears are mentioned in media are way more than the actual human deaths when one fear is compared with another fears. This visualization also tackles the problem of obstruction by layering different fears from bottom to the top based on frequency in each year.

However, I find that there is a big drawback of this visualization. There is neither actual number of media mentions nor deaths displayed in the visualization. With different baselines, even if there was a scaling on y axis, it would have been challenge to decode the actual value.
I think it would be better atleast to show the values in the description that appears when you click on a fear.
