This is an amazing visualization of a human body anatomy in a 3D view
And you can view the human structure by staring with skin tissue to 
filtering down to muscles, organs, organelles and just the skeleton.It is amazing how the body can be rotated 360 degress and zoomed in too
It probably has more features but need a subscription to look at it. This could be a next gen Electronic Health Record tool for physicians and also can be great tool for learning for all the healthcare service personnel involved with a patient

                All By Myself?

Its a very interesting inforgraphic done by a person while living alone during COVID. The person decided to record every day moods, actions and interactions. 
The inforgraphic is beautiful presentation of a person everyday life, hovering on the too tip give us if she interacted with somebody or hugged somebody. This was a really interesting and sweet inforgraphic.
