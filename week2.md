This week I want to recommend the website https://www.fifaindex.com/ . It's a database for all the football players. we can show all the stats by comparing the players you want. For example,
we could pick Halland and Ronaldo. And we also could get the players ranking to get the players you like in the game. The ranking is generated by the performance in the real world. And it's
also the trend for the Ballon d'Or. And the gamer who likes playing FIFA are keen on using this database, especially the comparison function. That's the dashboard I want to introduce this week.
