Humans have a long battle with infectious diseases. From the famous Black Death that devastated the Medieval Europe, to the ongoing Covid-19 that is surging around the world, pandemics have taken countless lives.   

Visualizing the History of Pandemics by Nicholas LePan is based on research data from CDC, WHO, BBC, Wikipedia, historical records, Encyclopedia Britannica and John Hopkins University. The scale of the illustrations is based on the recorded death toll to allow scanning and recognizing data easily.

This 3D illustration tells a stunning story of the pandemic history. It illustrated the name and year of the disease, the losses of lives due to each disease in chronological order. And ranked the losses of super-spreading pandemics by death toll. For each super-spreading pandemic, LePan highlighted the impact of the disease, the proportion of population that was affected during each pandemic. Even though the exact number of human losses is still under question, This impressive graphical representation showed how the statistical data of diseases scales with the growth of human population, and the long and winding history of humanâ€™s battle with pandemic diseases.
