This reflection was insightful and also incredibly impactful in its ability to use simple visualization like a bar chart, while being informative and easy to read. It discussed the inherent and neglected issue of misrepresentation of those with deeper skin tones in the beauty industry. It provided a discussion around the current naming conventions used to label beauty products and the inherent racism and bias that is present. Among some of these ideas was using a numerical scale to label shades, with lighter colors normally labeled or starting with 1, causing deeper shades to be numbers after 1. Other methods discussed was the usage of food and drink in labeling, which can cause dehumanization or even disrespect. The primary visual tool was a bar graph, however the visualist of this study used it in a way that was incredibly effective and purposeful. Utilizing swatches to represent the data in each bar within the bar chart, they were able to present the lack of of availability for those with deeper skin tones. Using the idea of swatches, they were able to provide a detailed illustration when discussing specific brands, and used these swatches as the bars on the bar chart to draw comparisons. The visualist also utilized color to their advanatage by ensuring each swatch was representing the shades that are available throughout the data industry. What was also interesting was the ability to hover over every shade presented on the bar graph, enabling users to get the specifics of every detail making up the bar graph.By hovering over a specific swatch or shade, the user is presented with a popup and provides the brand, color, shade name, and any other additional relevant information. By presenting the information with a hover and  a pop-up, it keeps the graph from getting cluttered and also provides a level of interaction that keeps the user engaged and interested to learn more.
