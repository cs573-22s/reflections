The Visualizing Health project is a repository of different displays for medical data. It aims to make communication of important medical information easier for doctors, and adapt the type of visualization to the data being presented and its specific goal. This website offers a wide range of categories that can be selected (what is the goal, should people remember details or just the gist, what health condition is this about, etc), making it very easy to narrow down options and pick the one that is most adapted.

I picked this because it's often difficult for professionals to convey ideas to people outside of their field, especially in medicine where being better informed has a huge impact on patients. I think it's a really good idea to have all those categories that you can choose, and while most of the visualizations are fairly simple, they're also fairly visual and effective. It's also important to mention that all these visualizations have been tested before, so there is research backing them, and pros and cons are listed when clicking on them.

I think the website might benefit from a wider range of visualizations because they only have 54 at the moment, but each one could also be changed and adapted, so it might make up for the small number they have. Also, while it helps guide and inform choices in visualizations, it doesn't seem to have templates available. This means that people would have to recreate visualizations on their own, which is a pretty big obstacle. Having templates would help make this website useful beyond just being a guide.
