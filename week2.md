# Week 2: 

My reflection for this week is from an article from the [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2017/business/women-pay-gap/)

## Description: 
This article picks up on the issue of gender pay gap. They start off by explaining the issue of gender pay gap using a visualization and then use interesting and intereactive visualizations so as to build on to their point which makes it very convincing. The article then produces the general claims people give surrounding gender pay gap and then produce compelling visualization to disapprove the claims.

## What I found interesting?

1. Starting with how they have written the title of the article itself, this whole article consists of interesting visualizations.

2. It goes on to build on the time a woman is potentially working for free in each of the sectors. It also allows the users to search for a profession or just go through a few of the professions as show.

3. The next visualization plots the number of men, number of women and the pay gap all on the same chart for various different jobs. As we scroll down there are multiple points which are made and the visualization keeps changing in the background. The visualization is a scrollytelling.

4. The article ends with a powerful visualization which is live. The numbers on this page keep changing. Although, it is not sure how these numbers have been calculated.
