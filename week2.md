## Reflection 2

This week I looked at a visualization for the sixth extinction. Essentially, we are in the midst of another mass extinction event. Similar to the meteor that killed the dinosaurs except this one is much slower and less flashy because it is being driven by anthropogenic climate change. This visualization is meant to illustrate just how much damage we have done and how many species we have driven to extinction already.

It accomplishes this task through the use of an interactive map of the world. This map displays just how many species in a given region have been driven extinct relative to the time scale selected below it. Larger circles on the map equate to more species loss and clicking on those circles specified which were lost. Now the default setting is for all species, however below the map are icons indicating subgroups of species like fish, birds, large mammals, etc. By selecting those icons you can see how each subgroup has been driven towards extinction over time specifically and where this activity takes place. Further down are two donut charts, the first depicts the percent of species deemed of least concern and those at risk. To the right of that is another chart which breaks down the percent of at risk species into subcategories like extinct, endangered, etc.

I connected with this visualization for a few reasons. Firstly, I find data journalism fascinating and incredibly important for exposing alarming data to the public in easily digestible and attention grabbing ways. To that point, I think this type of journalism focusing on the climate crisis and the current extinction event is even more important given the sheer gravity of that issue and damage it will inevitably cause if it is not gotten under control. Having read the Sixth Extinction, the book which was quoted at the top of the page, I had a much deeper connection to this visualization because it is an issue I am all too familiar with, but it feels like most others aren’t. From a technical standpoint I connected to this piece because it feels achievable compared to the last. This was likely made by a student and sets realistic expectations for the things that could be created in this class.
