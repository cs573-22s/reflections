# Reflection 2

For this week I read a study called "Evidence for Area as the Primary Visual Cue in Pie Charts" by Robert Kosara ([link](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8933547)), which attempts to find out the way
that poeple read pie charts from a glance. I read that there are three main ways of reading a value of a section of pie charts: by the angle of the section,
the arc length porportional to the circumference of the circle, and the area of the piece. Traditionally, the angle of the section
has been used due to the results of a previous study which became the consensus. However, Kosara hypothesises that this may not be accurate.
Participants were shown a number of pie charts with different values, some as 2D representations, others as 3D representations with a tilt
with varying angles to distort aspects of the pie chart and were asked to report their values. The results of all participants was compared against existing models
and it was determined that area may be the most accurate measurement method through this model.

This upcoming week, I want to try to investigate some more visualizations, but this study caught my eye and thought it was very interesting.
