This visualization is a depiction of the brain of a fruit fly. It is the most complete map ever created and the website shows various depictions of the neural connections that were found and recorded. The first animated display shows the layers and details in which the neurons connect to various parts in the brain. The second animated image is a clearer and more structured display of the pathes of the neurons within the brain of the fly. The third image is not animated but is a more understandable image of the amount of data that has been recorded. The blue highlighted region of this image is the same as what is dipicted in the first. Of the total of about 100,000 neurons in the fly brain, these visualizations show about 25,000 of those neurons.

I chose this visualization because i like more of the connections to biological uses. Also, This is a helpful in communicating the complexity of the brain along with all of its neural connections and pathways even in such a small organism. The data collection method for this endevor is also one to be acknowledged because of the amount of time and effort that goes into creating images such as these. According to the researchers, the microscopes used to capture data have to run continuously in order to get accurate reults. 

If the researchers and scientist behind this project are able to complete the full mapping of the brain of a fly, there could be even more motivation to expand to more complex organisms. One of the goals mentioned in this article was of contributing to unlocking the mechanisms and networks that are involved in the formation of memories. Expanding the abilities and tehniques used in this research could be further developed and improved to be used as a method of uncovering more mysteries of the brains network and building a cleaer understanding of the structure, connections, and complexity of the human mind and its operations.
