![Natsumii live chat](https://github.com/allyziemage/reflections/blob/master/livechat.PNG "Most used words/emotes in 5 minutes for Natsumii's chat")
### Why this?
I spend a lot of time on Twitch, so this week I looked for visualizations related to Twitch. This one was the most interesting to me because it has several components that stem from it's main question - what is the most used emote or word in the streamer's chat? The user can set different parameters, such as what time frame of messages to look at and how many emotes/words to rank. The streamer I looked at is doing an uncapped subathon (they will keep streaming according to the number of new subscriptions made) and as of the time of writing, she was asleep. Therefore, her chat was not as active as usual, so I set the parameters to the top 10 messages in the past 5 minutes. [Link to viz](https://chatgraph.live/twitch/natsumiii)

### Visualization description
The first screenshot here is the main figure on the website. It's a simple histogram and the colors of the bars reflect the chatter's user color. We can see the commonly used words and emotes. We can see a potential problem with visualizations like this as they can be biased towards common words, such as "the" and "is." These words don't give us much insight into the attitude of the chat, which leads to the next component of the visualization. There are four additional figures, one each for chat sentiment (valence, positive or negative), messages per second, distribution of words and emotes per second, and the ratio of words to emotes per second. Words without much valence, such as "the," may impact the data since they are not filter out of the dataset. I included the chat sentiment figure below. The visualizations aren't super interactive, as the only component the user can adjust are the aforementioned parameters. There are no hover features to give more information on specific figures or data that it is visualizing.
