# Week 2 Reflections

This week my reflection is on flame graphs visualizations and their use for profiling application CPU time. Flame graphs
visualize the hierarchical breakdown of a task into its component times. While they can be applied to a broad range of
topics, they see the most use in profiling applications.

I found this great [post by Brendan Gregg] on what flame graphs are and how they can be used to more efficiently express
how an application spends its time.
