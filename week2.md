## Reflection:

The visualization I am presenting this week is one from https://www.onezoom.org/. While I am not particularly in tune with how this visualization was made I think it is a cool representation of family trees in biology. I have come across many types of trees like this in the past but this one stood out because of how interactive and fun it was to explore. It is particularly cool to look at smaller groups of animals and how they descended from one another. Because this dataset is so large and a little incomplete it is a little bit weird to work with. If you scroll in to deep in some areas like the Eubacteria you may get lost in a sea of single cell organisms that are relatively unstudied which could be overwhelming. Overall its probably not the best resource for teaching or portraying a point but still a rather interesting visualization to play around with.
