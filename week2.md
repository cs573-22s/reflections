For this week's reflection and chose a data vis topic that always amazes me. understanding how many flights take place over the world in just one day is not as easy as one might think. The author of this visualization deciced to record all the flight comming into london for one day on the major airports. I think the way they decided to first show one by one and then at the end combining all the airports makes you realize how crazy flight control must be. it also makes you think that there is so much happening in the world other than what you are able to see! and it is only about london, imagine the airtraffic all across the world. I think there is a very big potential for making data visualizations using flight data, since is very accesible and public.
