I chose a visualization of antimicrobial resistance in europe. Bacterial resistance is a big issue in modern medicine, because bacteria become resistant to commonly used antibiotics and infections that could previously be treated easily are now much more difficult to deal with.

The website allows the user to choose antibiotics, countries, and the location of bacteria (human, animals, meat) with different drop down menus and buttons to click. The countries are categorized by cardinal directions as well, so the user can choose subsets of countries to focus on. The percentage of resistant bacteria is shown when hovering above the circles, and the size of the circles is also indicative of this number. 

I really like that there are many different ways to visualize the data. We can focus on one antibiotic and see circles for countries around it, or we can focus on a country and have antibiotic circles around it. The user has a lot of control over how the data is represented. There are also a lot of different options for bacteria and locations. 

One very minor downside is that the countries are abbreviated, and it would be nice to maybe have a legend that relates abbreviations to countries or that expands country names when hovering on bubbles. A lot of data is also missing, but that is just a problem with the dataset, not the visualization.
