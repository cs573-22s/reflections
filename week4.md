# Meteorites
We might not know if there is other life out in space, especially intelligent life, but we do know that there is a lot of flying debris. Meteorites are one of the few threats to the planet that isn't caused by humans, as seen by the massive blackout caused by the meteorite that landed on the Yucatan peninsula and caused the extinction of dinosaurs. While NASA and other space organizations have developed technology to potentially counter such meteorites in the future, primarily by reducing the size of meteorites as they approach Earth, these tools have not been officially tested on space debris with a collison course to Earth. 

# Visualization
The visualization I chose shows where the 34,000 recorded meteorites made impact with Earth and their relative size. The largest meteorites are named along with a depiction of how the largest would compare to a person. It is worth noting that these are the sizes of the meteorites after impact, not upon entering the atmosphere. Meteorites often break apart from the force of entering the atmosphere and the velocity of their descent. Finally, there is a timeline of the number of impacts per year along with two major events that may have triggered an interest in studying meteorites (and why the number of yearly impacts suddenly increases).
