### 3b1b Wordle video

(I hearby solemly swear I will stop doing wordle things... after this one)

This recent [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v68zYyaEmEA) from 3Blue1Brown provides what I would like to say is definitive commentary on the wordle starter word/solving algorithm issue. Through magnificent explainations of information theory and entropy, along with brilliant visualizations and animations to go along with it, 3Blue1Brown shows how to think about wordle in a mathmatical way.

The [graphs](https://youtu.be/v68zYyaEmEA?t=773) used to show the distributions of how much "information" a given word could potentially give, are clear, interactive (at least if you can get the [source code](https://github.com/3b1b/videos/blob/master/_2022/wordle.py) running), and perfectly follow along with what the narrator is trying to show. 

These graphs, along with the excellent [visual explaination](https://youtu.be/v68zYyaEmEA?t=494) of what a "bit" of information means, clearly explain the concepts to the viewer. Like when they explain the number of guesses required at a given point [here](https://youtu.be/v68zYyaEmEA?t=1624). 

The timestamps given are just the visualizations that I enjoyed the most, but the entire video is well worth watching if you have the tiniest bit of curiosity about wordle or information theory. I haven't yet dug through some of their [source code](https://github.com/3b1b/videos/blob/master/_2022/wordle.py), but I would be interested to see how some of these graph (along with the text and animations) are created so smoothly using python. 

Apologies for doing *another* wordle vis, but this one was too good to pass up.

Side note, it is interesting that none of the wordle vises we have found seem to agree on a starter word? This one says crane is best, but the other said completely different things!
