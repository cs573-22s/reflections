esearchers asked 10,000 people this question. More specifically, the collaboration between the University of Tokyo, MIT, and Recruit Institute of Technology asked participants on Mechanical Turk to list 10 happy moments. This generated a corpus of 100,000 happy moments called HappyDB.

Using (basic) natural language processing, they parsed out the main subject, verb, and object of each happy moment. Their parser isn’t perfect. Only individual words are categorized rather than phrases, it only uses the first sentence in multi-sentence statements, and it tended to have difficulties with incomplete sentences.

Nevertheless, it seemed to do enough to extract patterns in all these moments. They started with a straightforward look at the most used subjects, verbs, and objects.

The y-asix is top ranked words, and x-axis is the frequency.
