Introduction
---
This map shows the estimated net immigration (inflows minus outflows) by origin and destination country between 2010 and 2015.


Explanation
---
- Blue circles = positive net migration (more inflows)
- Red circles = negative net migration (more outflows)
- Each yellow dot represents 1,000 people.
- Hover over a circle to see that country’s total net migration between 2010 and 2015. 
  Click a circle (or tap the circle twice on mobile) to view only the migration flows in and out of that country.
- This chart use flow to show the source and whereabouts of migration which is a quite effective way.

Analysis
---
When US immigration is viewed by region, the area that really stands out is Asia, 
which now accounts for just as much US immigration as North + South America (Mexico included).

Immigration between the US and Mexico is particularly complex, 
since it involves both legal and illegal immigration as well as temporary laborers, deportations, and a large number of people living in immigration detention facilities. 
For that reason, America’s true net migration with Mexico is uncertain, and may actually be much lower than what’s shown here. 

Australia, another country where immigration has become a highly charged political issue, jumps out as an interesting case.

By these estimates, Australia’s net immigration is negative with every country in the world, 
except for a small positive immigration balance with Sudan. 
Australia is the only country in the world to have significant positive net immigration with the US.
