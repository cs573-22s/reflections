This paper reviewed the design patterns of using data visualizations to tell stories, such as the case with online journalism. Drawing on case studies from news media to visualization research, this paper identifies distinct genres of narrative visualization. It characterizes these design differences, together with interactivity and messaging, in terms of the balance between the narrative flow intended by the author (imposed by graphical elements and the interface) and story discovery on the part of the reader (often through interactive exploration). 

In the end, the paper also proposes some promising under-explored directions to journalistic storytelling. For example, one direction could be to focus squarely on readers’ experiences when viewing and interacting with narrative visualizations. Eye-tracking studies of newspaper reading have found that readers regularly skim by scanning graphics, headlines, and initial paragraphs before intermittently stopping to read an article. Based on these results, Garcia & Stark define newspaper design as the challenge “to give readers material that is worthy of their scan, that makes them stop scanning and start reading.” How do such behaviors apply to visualization? The paper suggested that further research is needed to characterize how readers perceive narratives presented via visualizations. Such studies could provide insights for design, such as how viewers might best “skim” a narrative visualization.
