This week I examined a visualization which allows you to explore every recorded gravitational wave event, found here: https://www.sciencenews.org/article/gravitational-waves-black-holes-spacetime-ligo-virgo. This visualization is based on data collected by the LIGO and its partner observatory Advanced Virgo, which together have recorded 50 sets of gravitational waves since they were first identified in 2015. The visualization contains a depiction of the event that produced the gravitational waves, including the result and original objects involved, plus the time of the event and date detected, a representation of the mass of the result, and in some cases an audio of the collision. Some events, marked in blue, also contain extra information such as the location in the sky or facts about the objects involved.

Overall, I think this visualization is very nice and more thorough than many of the other visualizations I've reviewed, as I found that important information was missing in some cases. The article it is paired with conveys any information and context that may have not been able to be shown in the visualization itself. The visulization is smoothly designed and visually pleasing. I also really enjoyed the audio recordings, although I'd like to know more about how they were created. Additionally, waving your mouse over the interactive pieces allows you to see a simple depiction of how the objects would've looked during the event - the interactivity overall is very nice.
