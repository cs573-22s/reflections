This visualization is a depiction of the population of Manhattan. The image display shows the estimation of population dynamics or fluctuations through the period of a week on an hourly time frame. A higher concentration of people is indicated by darker colors as corresponds to the color key in the top right corner of the image. The towers on the map are representations of the population block by block. The map of manhattan can also be observed by district which can be chosen by checking off the desired districks from the option box underneath the color key. The user has also has the ability to use the sliders at the bottom of the screen to cycle through the week days as well as the hours in the day to see specific times. In the top right corner, the user can click "story" to see an information box in the top left corner that they can click through see the story that gives more information about the trends of the population in Manhattan. There is another tab that removes the story box and focuses more on the visualization. The third and final tab shows the same visualization from a top view and adds a box that give statistics for the day and hour selected which includes the peak population change for the day and the estimated population at that specified time.

The map in the visualization can be zoomed in more to see the block by block populations better. When looking at the entire view, this visualization could be used to analyze or understand where the most populated place are. For example, the increase in population during the week days could be explained by work day commuters. Information like this could be used to later assess the types of devlopments that should be placed in certain area or where transpotation access should be focused. The information for the estimations of population came from the Metropolitan Transportation Authority turnsite database. Because of the source of the data, a possible method of enhancing this visualization could be to include the transporation system to give information about which ones are busiest at certain times. Having all of that information together would allow people to make plans ahead of time for places and activities that are less populated or crowded if desired. It could also be used by commuters to find a more efficient travel time/method to get to and from work or help them understand why the commute is a certain way.
