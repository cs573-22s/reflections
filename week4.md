# Reflection Week 4
James Plante

This week I found an [article](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/groundhogs-do-not-make-good-meteorologists/) 
by FiveThirtyEight about the inaccuracies of groundhogs in predicting whether or not there is going to be six more weeks of winter.
It turns out (unsurprisingly) that most are not very accurate. The
reason I found this interesting is that I found the article generally humorous and it provided some very vivid visualizations.

The first visualization that I found interesting was an analysis of Punxsutawney Phil's (a groundhog in Pennsylvania) accuracy over time.
The authors decided to go with a fan-like visualization with the instances of whether or not they predicted correctly with a percentage
of how accurate they were in the middle. I thought this was a great visual way to show time series data while giving a way to visualize
it categorically with no interaction whatsoever. They also provided a heatmap for the accuracy of different groundhogs based on region which
I found somewhat humorous since some groundhogs do worse than random chance. Another interesting visualization that they did was their
"bias" towards summer and winter which has a very interesting way of differentiating the different colors through texture.
