                        US - Gun Killings in 2018

This visualization tells us about the gun violence numbers in the year 2018
There were an astonishing 11,356 deaths due to gun violence in one year and 
this number excludes the suicides committed by guns which sums up the number 
to ~24,000 deaths. And it also estimates the stolen years of all the people
to be 472,332 which is a lot of years lost.  
The lines in the line graph represents one indivdual person and a two tool tips
one represents their age when they died and the circumstance in which they died.
The second tool tip represents an estimated life expectancy of that person, if
they were alive and their probable cause of the natural death
There is a second view to the graph it represents the count of deaths by age. And 
we can notice that no of deaths are higher between the age of 17 to 27 which
gives us clear idea of the impact of arms on teenagers and interstingly the no of
deaths amongsst 83 age group people seemed higher which might be old age abuse cases
that we hear about.
In addition, we can filter the data by gender, race, age group etc. 
The data reveals some important points
YOUTH ARE LARGELY AT RISK
BLACK AMERICANS ARE KILLED DISPROPORTIONATELY
HANDGUNS CONTINUE TO BE THE MOST DEADLY
MEN AND BOYS ARE THE MAJORITY OF VICTIMS
