# Week 4 Reflections
*[Link to Visualization]*

For this week, I chose to look at a visualization from nearly a year ago (Feb 26, 2021) about visualizing airflow in
classrooms to reduce the spread of coronavirus. This article consists of a scrollytelling visualization which shows a 3D
classroom with simulated airflow while the article discusses the different options. Unsurprisingly, due to the need for
smooth high definition web based 3D graphics, the visualization was backed using WebGL. While I was unable to try it,
the article also allows viewers to view the article in augmented reality instead via the instagram app. Granted placing
the link at the very end of the article likely

At its core, the article comes down to advocating the use of additional ventilation in classrooms. It serves as a
convincing argument, however I would have liked to have seen some data to back up their article. The room shown in the
visualization is entirely fictitious created for the visualization and the article does not site any additional
statistics. Without going too in depth, most of their sources appear to bee either quotes from health notable officials
recommending additional ventilation and consultation on the accuracy of the simulation shown in the article.
