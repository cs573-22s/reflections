This week found a chart that is both interesting and kind of sad. It's a chart that shows different parts of the world's temperatures compared to the average temperature from 1961 to 1990. We can see that the temperature increases globally from 1-celsius degree to around 2-celsius degrees. 

I found a point that needs to draw our attention the most. Even though the ocean and land temperature are increasing rapidly, from a global perspective, The average temperature in the arctic increased almost shockingly 2-celsius degrees, which is twice as land and ocean average increase from 1961 to 1990. even though it's not shown in the chart, I can see that at around the year 1990, the average temperature of the Arctic started to rise sharply. I assume it's because of the increase in industrial development. The good thing is that as technology develops, the concept of environmental protection is becoming more and more popular. I hope someday the global average temperature will not increase anymore.
