This is so cool a reflection this week, you can't miss it: https://flagstories.co/. There are many more ways of the data analysis about nation flags than you can imagine.

It's a project named flag stories, with all 23 aspects of analyzing a flag, including the most used flag elements, the flag tetris, the flag charts, the number of changes about flags about Asia & Oceania, Africa, America, Europe, 
the dominating flag layouts, the most dominating flag colours of the world, the most used flag colours by continents, the similar flags, the flag proportions, how old are national flags,
the continent flags, the complexity of flags, world history in flags, how flags are combined, flag families, what do flag colours symbolise, what do flag colours say about a country, 
when two flags become one, when is it national flag day, the most used symbols in flags, the most used main colors, the most used color combinations and number of colours in flags.

In addition to the diversity of content for flag analysis, the presentation of data is also very diverse, including ordinary bar charts, also there are a variety of more artistic bar charts. Besides these varieties of bar charts, there are stacked bar charts, treemap, map, bubble charts, and other innovative representations.

Let's choose some parts as an examples.

First, let's see a creative bar charts:

In this part, each flag is splited into elements and these elements are sorted by shape. After quantifying them and stacking them
into bar charts, we can see the most used flag elements. Interestingly, the graphics keep the shape of the original on the flag as much as possible, making this bar graph fun.

And here comes another beautiful design. All the flag elements are splitted into separate parts and then sorted by colors and stackeed together. 
This not only shows the percentage of colors in the flags, but also still manages to retain the unique elements. I think this part is very artistic and creative.

Sometimes common data displays can have a richer meaning when they represent specific content. Flags look so much more alike when leaving out layouts and simply visulize them as stacked bar charts according to color proportion.
It is amazing that so many countries have the same composition of colors, they only differ in proportion.

Then there is another very nice bar chart, using the flag connected as a bar chart is a novel form, but also can visualize the change of the flag, is a very functional visualization.

In the section on color usage statistics, another presentation treemap is used. Clearly we can see the primary colours. The authors also counted the use of different colors by region.

And here's some interesting comparision about the flags. Some flags have some relations with others, like rotate and mirror.

Here are also some statistics for regional flags, including color composition, flag layout and the use of special symbols. This kind of visualization is very clear and informative.

There is also the map visualization for clarifying the flag families. This simply tell where these kind of flags come from and the geographical connectivity.

Also, colors have many meanings, this chart I think is a combination of bubble chart and bar chart, on the one hand, lists the amount of different colors used, on the other hand, lists the percentage of different meanings of the same color.

And here is another special one, transforming the calendar into a pie-chart-like formation to show the national flag day, which is clear and creative.

Here's the reasons why I like this visualization a lot:
- The use of different kind of visualization is very creative and artistic. And from my perspective, there are a lot of good combination of different kinds visulizations, such as the combination of bubble chart and bar chart.
- The simple visualization can be used in a more different and interesting way. For example, in a simple bar chart, it can be combined with vary attributes like the color, the symbols and even the complexity, presenting the numeric proportion as well as the addition info.
- The content itself is fun enough. I can never imagine that the nation flags have so many interesting facts and the layouts and colors and the symbols have so much info to dig out. This is a very inspiration example of data visualization.
