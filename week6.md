This data visualization portrays global observations of mental health trends. It provides a map using color to differenciate difference percentages of how much each population has been diagnosed with mental health issues. This data visualization is interesting because for all of the data they provide different methods to portray it, using line graphs, maps, charts, and they even provide CVS files for all of the information. There are additional visualizations that provide more detailed information, like the prevalence of specific disorders globally represented by bar charts. The article goes into further detail about different types of disorders, looking into substance use disorders, depression, and deaths by suicide. Visualizations like this are important as it provides an insight into the trends that indivduals are suffering from and where disorders are the most common. By looking into this data and identifying where the issues originate from, researchers are able to find underlying causes. This data also displays the most common symtoms in specific disorders. Additionally, for those suffering from mental illness, being able to see data that shows that they are not alone can be comforting.
