What I find in last week is a website talking about solar eclipses. The most attracted me part of this website is a visualization you can explore solar eclipses paths. 

Each eclipse path is marked on the globe. You can drag the globe to explore each path. There is a hue bar corresponding to how long the solar eclipse will occur from the 2017. If the color of the path is darker, it means that the time of the solar eclipse is closer. If the color of path is lighter, it means that the time of the solar eclipses is farer. 

Besides finding the solar eclipses path, I think people can find more interesting things in this visualization. For example, we can notice that many solar eclipses will pass through south America and Australia but less will pass through India and middle Africa. Moreover, the main cities are marked on the globe. People can find the cities which solar eclipses will pass through in the future.

It is my first time to see solar eclipse paths in this way. This visualization is very cool for me.
