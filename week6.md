For this week’s visualization I chose one related to vacation destination google searches. Essentially this website explores the travel and vacation trends across the world through the trends in google searches. Admittedly this is on my mind as a senior because I myself am looking for a vacation to plan once I graduate. From a more academic standpoint I find this visualization very interesting and somewhat achievable in terms of a final project as I believe it was made entirely in d3.

It houses many interactable forms of visualization that compiles multiple different types of data into succinct and understandable graphs. Additionally, I enjoyed the sections where the author takes the time to explain how to read the different parts of her visualization. I’ve found that most of the time creators just throw you into their work without any barings, but this was very helpful in digesting the information presented.
