# Reflection 6

This week, I decided to utilize my New York Times subscription and find an interesting interactive visualization from The Upshot. The article
posits the question of how to best analyze the results of the Beijing Olympics: should we quantify which country "won" by how many medals
each earned or how many gold medals they earned? The article provides an interactive visualization providing users a way to explore how assigning
different weights to medal types effects the outcome of the ranking. The user can mouse over portions of one visualization using the mouse and see
the overall ranking on the right as well as how other countries performed. I found this genuinely impressive since it gives the users a very
interesting way to explore the data by just mousing over a visualization and doing a visual scan.
