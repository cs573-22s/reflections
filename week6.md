The vizualization for this week is something of a Covid-19 vaccination tracker. 

This tracker has multiple representation of data which are used to help keep tract of the vaccinations based on region, income level, and country. It is also tracking the speed at which various countries are geeting vaccinated. This first image in the website is a spinning globe that can be move with the mouse. Individual countries that have records of vaccinations can be clicked on and the percentage of people who have hrecieved at least one dose and the percentage of people who are fully vaccinated will be displayed under the country name. The countries are shown as a green gradients. The brightness/saturation of the green is representative of the percent of people given at least one dose of the vaccine. The more doses result as a increase in saturation. The next image appears to be a time series from 450 days eariler up until the last reported day of vaccination. When the mouse hovers over a line, it gets highlighted in green and the country it applies to is stated to the right. The line is also is a 7 day rolling average of these dosage counts. The final vizualization is a plot showing the percent of the population given at least one dose sectioned by continent. Under each continent, there are circles that show the the perc entage per country and the circles are sized by the amount of people per country. 

This is a useful vizualization in giving information of a countries vaccination status. There are small sections of information on the website also about the organization/operation that are collecting the data in order to make vizualizations like this possible. They have peaks of number of infections as well as deaths for each country that the data is avaliable for. It also has the vaccination phases that the country has released or has avaliable. With this information, it can be better viewed as to whcih counties need aid in being supplied vaccines and which have more coverage from the vaccines. Having multiple representations of similar/the same data can be helpful in engageing different people, gaining a clearer understanding, or reenforcing the infirmation.
