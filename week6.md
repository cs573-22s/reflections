# Week 6:

My reflection for this week is [this website](https://worldshap.in).

## Description:

The website uses a spider chart to study sustainability and human development. 

## What I found interesting?

1. The website starts with a spider chart showing different parameters of the entire world. There is also a slider below the chart which allows us to switch the data time period.

2. The website allows us to add any country/continent which are then simultaneously displayed together on the spider chart. We can even press the play button which then continously switches the data in the chart below as well as in the spider chart. This helps us to see the growth/decline in the ranks and the parameter values.
