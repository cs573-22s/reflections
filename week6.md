## Reflection

While trying to do research for our Assignment 3, looking into how to test understandability between two graphs, I found this paper on the understandability of Data-Gif's. Unlike traditional static visualizations data-gif's are data visualizations in gif or video format meant to grab the users attention. The reasearchers go on to look at how different lengths, types of repetitions and types of visualizations effect peoples understandability and interest in the story the data is trying to tell. Personally I am interested in potentially seeing how these gif's compare to other sorts of interactive charts and mediums of data visualization. The paper did adknowledge that the gif format could was not helpful for some groups of people, with more complaints towards gifs that quickly repeated without a clear starting and ending point and the lack of ability to pause the visualization to read more into it. But others reported that after a few cycles of a gif they would understand the data more than the first glance as they had time to look at smaller details in the visualization.
