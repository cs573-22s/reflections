# Linguistics
Linguistics is the study of languages. A common area of research is how words within one language relate to one another. Simple relationships include synonyms, or words that mean similar things, and antonyms, words that opposite. More complex relationships are things like words and their derivatives. For example, if we have the verb "to believe," we can derive the noun "believer." Understanding the relationships between words can assist people with growing their vocabularies or understanding the intent of others around them.

# VisuWords
VisuWords is a web-based application that shows words that are associated with a search word. The user can input a word they are interested in and the application will create a network of related words. The network is defined by differently shaped lines of varying colors. Most of the color choices are intuitive to understand; for example, green is for synonyms and red is for antonyms. A problem I found with VisuWords is that sometimes it will pull up the search word as a related word. The image below shows that "believe" is in the word network three times. It is possible that this is caused by some words having multiple definitions in the dictionary, so VisuWords might be searching for words based upon their definition instead of their name. This theory is confirmed by hovering the cursor over any of the bubbles and seeing the word's definition. Despite having the word "believe" multiple times, each instance has a unique definition.
