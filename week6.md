This week I came across this visualization: https://govdna.sudox.nl/#layout/dna/country/SUR/x/5/y/32/z/20/a/0. I really like how at first sight the visualization looks like a simple bubble graph, but as  I began to play around with the graph, I realized how intricate it really is. In terms of technical components, the graph has multiple views and forms of visualizing each country. Additionally, for each view there are different sets of filters and different ways of being able to visualize the data. I even like how the visual allows someone to see each different country and their respective attributes. As for the design components, I like the cholor scheme of the visual and how the colors are mapped to each country. Countries pertaining to the same region share similar colors or shades of the same colors. All in all, I think this a great visual that enables simplicity in user control, but conveys the data in high level.s
