This week I was able to find a more non-conventional data visualization from The Pudding. 
While this visualization doesn't convey standard numerical data comparisons,
what this visualization does offer is an overview of the designs of Air Jordan shoes. 
By displaying the design of each shoe in simple vector shapes you can see the changes
in design as the presentation goes through the years. By compiling the designs for all these
shoes into one visualization, you can compare, let's say, the design of AJVI to AJVII just as
any other data visualization would allow you to compare two separate points. The way
each shoe morphs into the next provides an added level of visual clarity to spot differences
and similarities between the designs. I like this idea of a more non-conventional visualization
because it's not always enough to just display numerical data, and so when tasked to display
information that's more subjective like the designs of shoes, how do you accomplish this task.
If The Pudding wanted to take a more hands-on approach, they could have allowed the user to select
specific sections from each shoe and see how they changed or disappeared over the years. Creating
a breakdown of extraneous elements like velcro, zippers, the swoosh, Jumpman, and other characteristics
and how often they appear or go absent would also improve this visualization. Even still, by using the designs
of these shoes as the data on which to compare and contrast over the basis of time, this visualization provides
the viewer with a new way to view these designs. The morphing feature is what sets this visualization apart 
from just a static timeline of images.
