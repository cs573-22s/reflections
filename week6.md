I chose an infographic from National Geographic about how much pharmaceutical drugs are found in fish. In class we often use articles or computationally created visualizations because they're the most relevant to us, but I think that sometimes physical visualizations also have their role to play.

The infographic is visually very impactful, with a fish that is made of pills that draws our attention. It makes us want to know what it means, and we stick around long enough to read the little bits of text that are there.

I think that this format is fairly good to draw attention to this issue, but maybe it's not the best to relay a lot of precise data. It works here because the percentages of each drug are written out, and we don't just have to rely on proportions to see the differences between drugs. If there were more drugs however, it would quickly get unmanageable.
This infographic is also a little misleading, because it represents the relative amounts of drugs found in fish (out of all the drugs found, what proportion each drug represents). It is easy to miss this distinction and wonder what the percentages mean. At first glance, one could believe that it means 46% of fish have narfluoxetine in them, or even something else.

Overall, this is an impactful visualization, but not much else. The data is fairly narrow ins cope, and the representation can be a bit ambiguous before reading the text. However, grabbing people's attention and raising awareness seems to be the main goal of this visualization, and in that it succeeds. In some cases, that's all you need from a visualization.
