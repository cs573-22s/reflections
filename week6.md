This week I looked at an interactive visualization of tree species planted in the five boroughs of New York City (https://www.cloudred.com/labprojects/nyctrees/). This visualization contains a divided bar chart, with each bar representing a different borough. Each segment represents a type of tree and its size represents the quantity of the specific type of tree. There are 73 types of trees listed, with another 1 category designated for all unknown trees. Below the bar chart is a graphic showing the list of trees in alphabetical order with a silhouette of what they look like. By clicking on each tree type, you can see which segment of the bar chart it represents, how many there are in each borough, and what percentage of trees are of that specific type. You can also select multiple types of trees at the same time to add these amounts. 

Overall, I think this visualization is really nice. It is visually pleasing, informative, easy to use, and fun to click around in. I think some more information about the tree types would be nice, even simply just a link to a Wikipedia article. I would also love some more insight into the tree types planted - for instance, of the 51661 trees planted in Manhattan, where are the 3 beech trees that apparently exist there? It would also be nice to have a little map of the 5 boroughs, just to get an idea of the geography.
