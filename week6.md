This visualization shows the different types of debris that have been created from stuff we've launched into space. The y-axis is linear showing the average distance you can find each given thing from earth, and the x-axis organizes by type. There is a lot of information in the viz, as this graphic is essentially trying to map out 5 dimensions at ounce: distance, mass, origin, time, and type. Because of this, the graphic might seem a bit cluttered at first. I think for the given number of dimensions, this graphic is actually pretty clean. Without interactivity, it's difficult to fit these things together. However, I think the design choices allow this to work.

The circles represent the number of each object at said distance, while the lines leading up to them have a thickness based on their mass. Timelines are also provided at the bottoms of each of the object type x-labels. I really like the color scheme. The dark blue background works well with the space theme. I like the interesting color gradient for each of the circles. I like how the circles contain numbers (so sizes can be compared). I think the font choice works as well; i see it a lot in visualizations with map data.

I might add a weight map to the graphic for the circles. The n the size of the circles represents is based on area, not radius. The y-axis scales linearly on the other hand, but has distinct labels at major, yet seemingly arbitrary points. This might be able to work if they gave labels to what is interesting about those heights. All of the different groupings have the same set of y values. This is kind of a strange way to do it because some of the values are 0, and we don't have a sense of the actual gradation of satellites.
