For this week's visualization, selected this one:
https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/comments/swaxj7/oc_my_viz_on_formula_1_champions_and_top/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf


This visualization summarizes the last 21 years of the f1 seasons, it highlights who won each year and what team they are part of, it also allows you to look at the performance of each 
Team separately by clicking on the cars.

I think the format used allows us to see all the data nicely abs even though is a lot of information is very easy to read.
