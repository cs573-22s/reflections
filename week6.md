This week's visualization is from https://informationisbeautiful.net/visualizations/food-waste/. It provides an informational graphic about food waste in the world. It has multiple different components to allow for different data to be displayed in many different ways and is very informative. There are several data visualizations following each other, almost creating a story with the information. The overall design of the visualization is eye-catching due to the initial bright pink color of the background. The top of it starts off with large numbers accented in a bright blue color so that it pops out on the page. These numbers indicate important data surrounding food waste in the world: that 18-30% of the world's food is wasted and that 8-10% of global emissions come from wasted food. Each number has a visual of a square with the corresponding percentage shaded in. 

Beneath that is a treemap which displays the percentage of food waste by food type as well as source. Underneath that is a population pyramid which shows how food waste would compare in emissions if it were its own country. Then there is a mini circle packing graph depicting how much food is wasted in the UK. There are also many larger numbers which indicate important facts. After that, there is a version of a parallel’s coordinates graph, followed by large icons of what drives household waste. Each section is titled in big white letters to help guide the viewer through the document. The following sections have different forms of visualizations, each unique in its style, while also efficiently conveying the data it’s supposed to. 

I especially liked this visualization because it was able to present so much information in so many different ways. It was very nice to see how visually appealing the author made it as well.
